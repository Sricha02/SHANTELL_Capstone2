3663,97856,2010-09-15,211347,Véga,"we really enjoyed our stay at shawn's and richard's place.
their house is well-located in a calm area but near from restaurants and pubs. it is tidy, warm and nicely decorated.

they make everything to make you feel confortable and at home which was easier for us as they speak french fluently: breakfast, use of the balcony which means coming to their room, laundry...

plus, they give lots of advice about where to go, how to go in the city.

we recommend this place for a real airbnb experience.

3663,120132,2010-10-16,196456,Brett,"shawn and richard were fantastic! truly! in addition to having a beautiful home (more below)- they were always very fun to chat with when our schedules overlapped. i have roomshared before and they are the standout best. they are very warm and welcoming, and the house is beautiful and comfortable. the room had plenty of space, was super clean, and very nice. also- the space was quiet despite being a few blocks from a very busy area. they provided me with tons of information about great things in the city and the location of the house is incredibly convenient- close to lots of great parks, bars, and restaurants, as well as easy to get to dc's great public transportation system. 
i would recommend shawn & richard's place without any reservations and look forward to staying with them again should i return to dc!

3663,125719,2010-10-24,246755,Levi,shawn and richard are wonderful hosts - very accommodating and friendly.  they are very knowledgeable about the area and provided some useful maps and directions for getting around town.  they have a wonderful place - beautiful neighborhood that easily connects to buses and a short walk to metro stations.
3663,132840,2010-11-03,32703,Ranen,"sean and richard,

thank you, thank you, thank you for making our stay in dc wonderful!!
note to potential airbnb renters …… these guys are hard to beat!  even before we arrived, we were given directions from the airport (witheasiest route included) and  info on the house and arrangements.
once we arrived at the house, sean left an info packet with critics and directions to many neighborhood restaurants and attractions and directions to the capitol.  in addition, he had several tourist
pamphlets and a dc map and metro map to help with getting around.  
the house is nestled in the  quaint “adams morgan “ area of dc (near the zoo) within walking distance to two metro stations and easy bus accessto the capitol.

our hosts were great and made us feel at home every day.  continental breakfast was available every morning.

i aspire to be as magnificent of a host as shawn and richard are. wonderful men, very chill, organized ""home"", laid back houshold. i would rent floor space for my wife and i if that is all they had  before trying to stay with anyone else in d.c.
cheers, ranen sherman and jeanette asselin"
3663,196726,2011-03-11,393528,Emily,"shawn and richard are wonderful hosts! they are so accommodating and i really felt at home in the house. their home is gorgeous and full of international charm with beautiful art and their own pictures all over the place. they were a pleasure to stay with and a joy to get to know. if you want somewhere that you can relax and feel at home, this is a great spot for you (i only stayed 3 nights and this was still the case, it's that cozy). it's also so easy to access anything you would need in dc--the metro, fun food spots, etc. i would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
3663,199809,2011-03-15,281438,Anne,"it was really nice staying at shawn's. unfortunately we did not get to meet the two but there were really helpful over the phone and flexible, too!
the house is great and located in a nice neighbourhood. we would always choose them again!"
3663,201874,2011-03-17,436796,William,hosts are very accommodating.  i enjoyed exploring the neighborhood - particularly the restaurants.  the only issue is parking ... definitely a pain  in the butt !!!
3663,441777,2011-08-13,583416,David,"shawn and richard were amazing hosts; they went above and beyond to make sure that i had everything i needed. i was very busy and mostly used the room just as a place to stay, but they are very well set up for out-of-town guests: they are warm and friendly, have tons of local knowledge, and provide a homemade visitor's guide to the neighborhood. the house itself is charming and well situated, on a quiet street but very close to nightlife and restaurants, and convenient to the rest of dc."
3663,456858,2011-08-18,873447,Pascal,"nous avons séjourné très brièvement à washington dc avant de repartir pour l'europe. richard et shawn ont fait preuve de beaucoup d'hospitalité et de confiance, nous laissant disposer de leur jolie maison.  nous avions été en contact auparavant pour planifier notre arrivée dans la capitale et savoir quel moyen de locomotion emprunté jusqu'à leur maison. "
3663,473043,2011-08-24,486603,Jordi,"shawn and richard are great hosts! they are a very friendly and funny couple. it was a pleasure the meet them.
they gave lots of tips about restaurants and places about dc. they also printed out these tips, maps for going around the neighborhood and some useful general information about the city.
the house is located in adams morgan, a few blocks from a restaurants and bars area. there is also a subway and bus stations 10-15 mins from the house.
the room is as shown in the pictures, clean and comfortable. the bathroom is shared with the hosts, although that didn't mean any inconvenience.
highly recommendable is someone is planning a short visit to washington dc.
"
3663,482710,2011-08-28,606071,Donetha,"shawn and richard were really nice hosts. they provided us a last minute check in which we were really appreciative of. they made sure we had everything we needed and more. we would definitely stay here again if needed. shawn and richard thank you for having us in your lovely home, we really enjoyed it. "
3663,496069,2011-09-02,942605,Beth,"i could not have asked for a better stay with richard and shawn.  their lovely home provided me a wonderful sanctuary for nearly four days. i was due to arrive the same time as hurricane irene and they gladly refunded my money for the night i was unable to stay.  i immediately felt comfortable here, and richard and shawn went out of their way to provide info and advice, as well as just general support and friendliness. they are both down to earth hosts, hilarious and unpretentious yet professional.  i very much appreciated my stay here and will certainly be back.  on a logistical note - the location is great and i didn't have trouble either with parking (late at night) or using the metro."
3663,511223,2011-09-07,195756,Jim & Chris,"shawn and richard were great  hosts! we were welcomed with a bottle of wine and friendly conversation. there was a very nice breakfast layout in the morning with fresh strong coffee. they were a great resource for getting around the city, local eateries and assistance with arranging early transportation to the airport upon our departure. 
shawn displayed his myxology talents and richard provided insight into the art and decor of their home. we felt welcomed and at ease, and would recommend all travellers to the dc ares to stay with these consumate hosts."
3663,523845,2011-09-12,924523,Sarah,this was a great place to stay with our little girl.  we enjoyed the neighborhood and the house.  
3663,536759,2011-09-16,973496,Eh,"shawn and richard's home took me back home to  san francisco - it's warm, cozy and  inviting . 
the room was comfy and private, despite a shared bath.
but it was shawn and richard themselves that made this place more like home- their hospitality and genuine care shows through. and unlike other hosts, they are low maintenance and very easy to deal with. i feel that i've gained two friends. 
thanks, shawn and richard and am looking forward to staying with you again."
3686,131293,2010-11-01,257234,Callie,"staying with levita and her wonderful family was an amazing experience. they were so welcoming to me and her home was great. i cannot express enough how nice my experience was. not only is levita's home very close to the metro, extremely comfortable, but her vegan cooking was incredible as well. anyone would be lucky to stay with such a friendly, welcoming family."
3686,150766,2010-12-08,255888,Patrick,"vita is a very welcoming, helpful and friendly host and a great cook. her house is located in an interesting, not to say fascinating, area of washington dc. transport connections are close by and very frequent, the house (and the room where i stayed) are furnished in a very elegant style and i was always happy to come home in the evening to the friendly atmosphere of the household of vita and her two daughters.   "
3686,177749,2011-02-02,366688,Benjamin,"this was my first time using ""airbnb"" and it made me wonder why i ever stayed in hotels in the past!! vita was the most incredible host. her home was warm and inviting,  full of beautiful artwork and artistic people. the bedroom was immaculately clean and comfortable. it felt like a vacation...i even started my morning with a hot, leisurely bath! vita is a wonderful chef, and runs an awesome food blog where she diary's her generous out-pouring of love and soul through food. i could write a whole blog myself on the wonderful experience i was treated to during my stay. but vita is a great storyteller, so i'll leave the details to her....check out her blog and learn something about healthy and delicious food in the meantime. (website hidden by airbnb)"
3686,197451,2011-03-12,213492,T.J.,"first, vita saved my work week by providing me with very very very last minute acomodations.  vita's home was an absolute urban oasis!  i was absolutely comfortable with the private accomodations.  i regret not being able to spend more time with vita and her family.   i had a wonderful stay and look forward to being a guest in the future."
3686,213212,2011-03-30,428455,Pete & Leila,"great host! very welcoming and organised. i stayed for three nights while sightseeing in d.c. - the location is very convenient and vita provided maps and guides. the room is lovely, the shower is hot and vita shared her tasty vegan cooking! would happily stay again."
3686,218619,2011-04-05,459821,Manoj,"our first experience with airbnb and it was a great start. we wanted to visit dc for the cherry blossom festival and we found vita's place for the dates we were looking for. she was warm and welcoming. she provided us with all the information about the location such as transportation and food. she had maps and menus in the room which were very useful. room was warm and cozy. 

we couldn't believe how close it was to the tidal basin and national mall. just 3.5 miles. and yet the location is quiet and away from the noise. although food is not included, she did ask us for breakfast (which was nice), but since i enjoy photography, we always left very early to catch the morning light. 

dc is a big place and obviously we have a lot to see and do and vita's place is the first choice. 

thanks."
3686,228027,2011-04-16,473384,Leah,"vita was a wonderful host. due to flight delays i came in at 1am and she still gave me a tour of the house, explained sights and nearby eateries. wonderful host. the room and bathroom were clean, privacy completely respected, and i never felt like i was intruding on anyone. although i did not spend too much time there i did get to experience a little of vita's wonderful vegan concoctions. about a 5-7 min walk to anacostia metro & took around 10-15 min to get to convention center. truly an enjoyable part of my visit to d.c."
3686,246229,2011-05-01,382759,Meghan,"i enjoyed staying at levita's place and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is visiting the dc area. her place is a quick 10 minute walk to the metro and then another 10 minutes or less to downtown dc and all the main attractions (the mall, the smithsonian museums, the tidal basin, etc.). levita and her kids were friendly, and if i was around during dinner time, they were very nice in asking me if i wanted to join them. the place is clean and the room was comfortable. i would stay there again if i'm in the dc area."
3686,258972,2011-05-10,544959,Dongyub,"i needed a place to stay only for 2 nights in washington, d.c. it was right after my internship program ended and vita's place provided me with perfect accommodation. she introduced me another korean who was also staying in her house and we could share some stories. i didn't have a chance to taste vita's dishes ( because i was out all the time while i was staying )  but i could feel she was a real cook. i was curious about vegan cuisine and she made me feel understood about it and even gave me her teaching book which helped me a lot grasp about vegan diet. thanks vita! :)"
3686,273209,2011-05-21,480566,Praveen,comfortable accomodation. vita is an excellent host. anacostia station being close is an advantage. the neighbourhood is fastly developing.   
3686,286752,2011-05-29,261327,Alvaro,"vita is a very interesting person from whom i learned a lot in the little time i spent with her. during my stay in dc i tried food from morroco and also an ethiopian place, but i found that the nicest culinary experience during my stay in the capital was levita's famous vegan cooking.  vita is very welcoming to her guests and has a lot of exerence hosting people. she is also respectful of privacy, as well as a great connoiseur of the city.  the only down side is that the area is not the place place to be walking in at night.  "
3686,319951,2011-06-17,698118,Elysia,i came directly here from the airport and was grateful to be accommodated on short notice. vita was a gracious host and extended kindnesses to help me get to her place with my heavy luggage. the bed was comfortable & the large tub was a nice treat. the neighborhood may be preferred by some travelers during the day. the house felt restful and was a pleasure to be in. 
3686,346914,2011-07-01,372999,Brady And Angie,first time with airbnb and was great. nice room and wonderful host. 
3686,406270,2011-07-30,725011,Becca,"vita jean's place is comfortable and she has some really great neighbors all around.  i walked down the bus stop and the metro that is not too far from her house and i really enjoyed walking in her neighborhood. 
i was suffering from a sinus congestion when i first arrived at her place and she was so kind and concern. she cooked a ghananian stew that was really delicious and helped with my sinus congestion. i loved every dish that she prepared and really enjoyed being a vegan for 2 weeks. i didn't miss any kind of meat or seafood the whole time i was staying with her. i also learned a lot about healthy eating and preparing healthy meals. 
the whole experience with vita jean was such that i feel like i have found a home away from home. she has this wonderful southern hospitality that makes you feel so much at home. her two lovely daughters were very helpful as well and they both made me feel like part of their family. i definetely will stay there agian when i return to dc."
3686,419939,2011-08-04,848202,Climerio,"vita is a great person, and her place is very nice and comfortable. although we had a short and busy stay, we enjoyed the time we spent with her and her family. "
3686,435063,2011-08-10,867994,Caleb,levita is awesome! i will definitely come back and stay again when i am back in d.c. also any musicians auditioning for the marines or coast guard this is very conveniently located to both bases. 
3686,476609,2011-08-26,846958,Max,"vita's great! and her home is lovely. she goes out of her way to make your stay wonderful. on top of everything, in fact, she gave me a recommendation for where to take a date: frederick douglas's dc home is right down the street from her place, and is now a museum on a hill that overlooks all of dc. how classy would that be? "
3686,540922,2011-09-17,213492,T.J.,"vita's home is warm and inviting.  the location is ideal for those needing to use public transportation and want to explore more of washington, dc.  the accomodations in the home are private and comfortable.  i was able to come and go with no problems.  vita's hide away is perfect for the traveling professional!"
3686,567002,2011-09-25,1171357,Aleksandra,the house is wonderful and especially vita and her family. i was there 4 days and i really like that room:))
3686,728038,2011-11-18,1112391,Sylvain,"levita is a great host really nice host, and made my stay in washington much better than expected."
3686,732721,2011-11-20,1415107,Andrzej,"my stay at vita's place was very nice and i was realy happy to be there.  my only regret is that for professionnal purposes i couldn't stay longer. i had the pleasure to be hosted by vita two days and two nights. the room and the bathroom where perfect. i liked the simple and cosy furniture.
vita is such a kind person that told me about things to see and where to eat in anacostia. as for exemple, thanks to her indications i went to cedar hill the house of frederick douglass, statesman and leader of the abolitionist movement. it was  a lesson of afro-american history that i am thankful for. and i ate a very good jamaican meal.
in vita's house i felt like at home. there is something  that makes her place i could say the frendliest place in dc filled with love and warm enregy. 
i hope that one day i will be able to be a guest in her house when back in dc."
3686,834476,2012-01-03,600310,Michael,"vita has a lovely and comfortable home. 
she is a generous and talented vegetarian cook.
she is also very friendly and helpful."
3686,883152,2012-01-25,1609396,Alexandra,"my three nights at vita's were utterly pleasant!  i rented a car for my visit and was very glad that i did; parking was easy at her house as well as around dc and at the air force base (was in town for an audition).  i never paid for parking the entire time i was there, and the car rental was 60 dollars for three days.  i was pretty busy so didn't get to spend much time around the house, but i did enjoy a delicious vegan brunch with vita and her daughters the first morning i was there.  my room was clean and i had a cute bathroom with a pedestal bathtub.  comfortable environment; i'd definitely stay with her again in dc.  thanks for a great time!"
3686,981534,2012-03-08,851617,Jon,"vita was very friendly and eager to help. she gave me some good advice on where to go and what to see, and had plenty of information about local food places. the location isn't bad; it's a 20 minute train ride to the city and there's an interesting museum down the road."
3686,1035895,2012-03-23,312205,Ramesh,excellent house and host. very serene ambiance. would definitely consider coming back to stay at vita's. thank you.
3686,1052839,2012-03-27,139821,Kevin,"there's not much i can add to all of the great reviews vita gets. during my stay i was made to feel welcome and at home. her house and family are warm and inviting, and the historic neighborhood is great for those looking for a brisk walk. i wouldn't hesitate to stay with her again!"
3686,1059907,2012-03-29,1547637,Christine,"vita is a great host. she kindly provided me information on restaurants when i arrived. her house is artistic and located in a quiet place. it is only a few minutes walk to the metro. i was concerned about parking on the street, but there are plenty of parking spaces next to the house. i only stayed for two nights, but i wish i could had more opportunities to talk to vita. "
3686,1125271,2012-04-13,261805,Tony,"it was a real pleasure staying with vita and her family.  we had a great time talking about her family history and many other topics.  i arrived on easter and was treated to a vegan meal.  the house is quite charming, reminiscent of the craftsman-style house i once owned in santa cruz. i would definitely stay with vita again."
3686,1152337,2012-04-19,2034569,Marje,"vita is delightful individual and am sorry no opportunity presented itself to enjoy one of her vegan entrees. neighborhood is in flux but it never felt unsafe. 


would stay again. "
3686,1181144,2012-04-25,1546503,Christina,"my husband and i had a generally pleasant stay at vita's. she's warm and friendly when we first met on the morning after we arrived and had been very quick to respond when we inquired about her place prior to our booking. her house is big, roomy and cosy. the bed's the best! super comfortable! sheets, comforter, towels and bathroom were clean. :) a  jug of drinking water on the first day, some tips as to the availability of convenience stores, food places in the neighbourhood and a courtesy check on how we are doing at her home when we were both home together on the third evening we were there would have been much appreciated. "
3686,1213769,2012-05-01,1521266,Alvin,"really love the place - not far from the center of the city but not exactly in the middle of the bustling city. vita is a warm host and lovely cook, who made my stay in dc enjoyable. definitely would come back in the future."
3686,1302867,2012-05-19,1997828,Adèle,i had a wonderful time at vita's house! vita is such a great host. the room is comfortable and very clean. you can use the kitchen every time you want. i shared a meal with vita : she is a good cook! i would really recommend this airbnb. it's close to the subway and it only takes 20 minutes to reach the national mall. 
3686,1357761,2012-05-27,2291980,Thobe,"vita is an angel! a very warm, interesting and honest person! i thoroughly enjoyed my stay and the long conversations we had. my room and especially the bed, as shown in the picture, was as comfortable as promised and i felt right at home. i didn't get to experience her culinary cooking skills though... maybe next time, vita? good location also, and although i enjoyed the short walk home, i would recommend a taxi to all female visitors. communication is prompt and lavita was extremely accommodating wrt checking in and out times, and when i needed a bed on short notice. go memphis!"
3686,1395744,2012-06-01,2322111,Shuja Parvez,"if you interact with vita, you will realize what a polished person she is! she has a good knowledge about washington, especially about the nitty gritties of anacostia. do interact with her and get to know about the history of washington's upcoming and historic anacostia district.

moreover, her place is very clean, well located and the facilities are as described. i recommend that you do stay with her and make it a point to have some interesting discussions with her.

vita, it has been a pleasure to stay with you and get to know you. if i visit dc again, i know where i want to stay :)."
3686,1449997,2012-06-10,2352827,Peter,vita was a wonderful host! she was always gracious and willing to help and even made us a delicious meal the first night we arrived! my brother and i stayed in her hideaway for 6 nights in total. the room was lovely although a little cramped for two people for a week. our only complaint would be the shower was a little difficult to use (tub with no curtain) but that was a very minor inconvenience. overall a great place to stay- get to see the real dc!
3686,1572127,2012-06-26,2491432,Naivasha,"vita was a wonderful, warm and welcoming host. her children are just as lovely and are a real credit to her. the room is compact, but is clean and has all you need in it. on arrival, vita sat us down and (with a glass of chilled water) and gave us the run down about local sights, transport options and restaurant recommendations. she even took us out with her to a brilliant party, introduced us and made sure we were at home. on top of all of that, vita shared some of her tasty cooking and imparted some of her stellar cooking tips! we would definitely recommend this place to others."
3686,1645665,2012-07-06,2500985,Sarah,"i loved vita's house and i really enjoyed hanging out wtih her and her beautiful daughters. the neighbourhood is a little rough but i never had any reason to feel unsafe, and her house is close to the subway so it is also easy to get around. "
3686,1660678,2012-07-08,2721238,Intisar,"quite a friendly atmosphere. vita jean was available and very helpful during my brother's stay here in the washington dc area. they are located near transportation which made it easy to get around town. thanks for all your good efforts.

kirk' sister"
3686,1700870,2012-07-13,2743531,Lis,"vita jean was a great hostess.  she made me feel very welcome and even came to get me from the train station when it was pouring rain outside.  the place was clean and comfortable, and i loved the fact that she let me use her piano for practicing.  the only drawback was the neighborhood which is not great.  you should definitely take the time to figure out the bus system, and she makes it easy for you by putting all of the bus schedules in your room.  i would definitely recommend staying with her anytime.  "
3686,1908479,2012-08-06,3107767,Cia,"once reaching vita’s accommodations she is engaging and responsive to requests/needs as long as she can accommodate the same. vita and her family are very creative, talented folk who rises above their peers. such disposition merits the best of all.  "
3686,2064049,2012-08-22,867994,Caleb,"i love vita's hideaway. if you are a musician auditioning for any band in dc on barracks row this bnb is a 6 minute drive away or a 15 minute ride on the bus ($1.80 per ride in cash).  don't stay in an expensive bad hotel, come stay at vita's. "
3686,2390677,2012-09-24,3043973,Sandra,all the good things mentioned in vita's reviews are indeed true. i loved my stay there. such a  good experience with a caring family.
3686,2502841,2012-10-04,3041747,Boaz,"nice family and lovley daughters
but the house was dirty. 
because of the dirt and grime in the kitchen we could not even make a cup of tea in the morning.
 i am sorry but after reading the past reviews we decided to book a place and this will be my last time in vita's hide away 
 when we orderd a taxi we waited for more then two hours and when i calld the again  they said that thair drivers don't to come because of the dangerous and poor neighborhood and  that was not in the previous reviews.
for someone like me that  came with his daughter outside the united states and  does not know washington  this experience is not pleasant to experience and maybe a little scary and should have written on web that  the neighborhood is dangerous neighborhood"
3686,2633163,2012-10-16,2614064,Rodger,vita jean is an exceptional host and a wonderful person. staying with her was a highlight of my trip.  the room was very comfortable. i have no hesitation in heartily recommending you stay with vita jean. 
3686,3829463,2013-03-18,5356219,Star, perfect room for single female! 
3686,3982368,2013-04-01,3529688,Tatiana,"vita is really nice, she's friendly, helpfull, and she has 2 beautifull doughters, it's a really nice family. the house is well located few minutes from the metro, and few metro stations from city center. you have your own bathroom, you're really independent.
you will enjoy your stay!"
3686,4096121,2013-04-09,2080591,Xuan Kathy,"we came to stay at ms. vita's for washington d.c's cherry blossom festival during the april5-7th. ms. vita's house sure is a hideaway, she has decorated it very nicely.. and i am one who loves homes with character and hers definitely was. we were first welcomed by ms. vita on friday evening, and she showed us the different bus routes, train routes in her area. it's a wonderful house, light and airy with beautiful light and breeze coming in. the beds were soooooo comfortable, we crashed to sleep as soon as it got late. hard wood floors, so they do creak, but we didn't mind. ms. vita even offered to make breakfast or left food on the stove for us..but we never got to try it! the timing for us was off somehow.. sorry ms. vita, wished we could've tried some too! 

i know that for an outsider who is coming into the anacostia neighborhood, it may seem a bit rough and eerie with some boarded up houses; but my boyfriend and i always walked together to get to the trains or buses and even came back late night one time.. and were very aware of the surroundings. the neighbors minded their own business, said hi to you as you walked. nobody were giving any mean stairs or anything. 

there are bike rentals right outside the anacostia green-line station, woot!-- loving the bikeshare idea. we just never got a chance though =( there is so much to do and see. her location was very accessible to buses or trains..using the (website hidden by airbnb) website made it especially helpful. 

thank you for everything ms. vita. we wish you and your daughters the best, and may you also get to go see wonderful cities and be hosted by wonderful people like yourself. it was an honor."
3686,4628257,2013-05-16,6109133,Fabian,"levita 's place was very clean and close to the green line which will take you to all the cool places in dc . levita was a great host and was very helpful , she even provided metro cards so we saved some money while using the trains . the neighborhood looks rough but was very safe . we came home late and never felt uncomfortable . the room was very clean and the beds were super comfortable . it is a true hideaway with a lovely artistic vibe and definitely worth a stay ! "
3686,6239154,2013-08-05,6275969,Edward,"vita's place is very comfy and has a very homey feel to it. it is very close to the center of the city and not too far from the metro, making it an ideal place to stay and go have fun in the city. vtia's house was never loud and i never felt uncomfortable in her neighborhood. this room was made exceptionally better by using the small ac unit that vita has. "
3686,6587986,2013-08-18,5264023,Emma,vita and her sister were lovely hosts. her house is really awesome and the bedroom was just what i needed after a day of sightseeing. 
3686,7387598,2013-09-17,8317498,Jakob,we enjoyed our stay at vita's place. although the neighborhood isn't that great we did feel comfortable and safe at vita's place. vita is a good host and really tries to make the best of your stay.
3686,7840200,2013-10-05,9093154,Tsiry,had a great time! too bad i was out of the house most of the time so i didn't manage to get to know vita and her lovely family a bit better. hopefully next time ;) ...
3686,8145050,2013-10-17,114470,Steve,"very nice accommodations in an older residence.  the hostess and her family are very gracious.

3771,588,2009-01-21,6413,Kevin,charlene and her home were absolutely wonderful.  we would recommend to anyone!
4002,444,2009-01-20,4965,Kristin,"this was a great experience for my friend and i.  the apartment was in a great location, and we would stay there again."
4002,528,2009-01-21,4051,Traci,"i really enjoyed my stay at anthony's place on allison st.  it was clean, roomy and comfortable. i would definitely recommend staying there.  it is close to public transportation."
4002,26064,2010-02-14,72495,Jennifer,"it is close to the bus stop but a little farther away to the metro (about 1.5 miles).  this is only a problem when lots of snow is there, we were there during the biggest snow storm ever in dc.  anthony helped give us directions and everything was as he said it would be.  i would recommend :)"
4002,26920,2010-02-20,66501,Phillip,"anthony was a great host. the apartment was clean, beds comfortable & almost everything we needed was present. it does need a few fine-tuning touches though; lamps not working, lamp shades at odd angles, tv remote not working & oddments of furniture, cutlery & crockery. we would have loved some big mugs to enjoy tea or coffee. on the whole it was a great stay even though it was some distance from brookland station."
4002,28888,2010-03-09,88949,Latifah,so i am a college student out of va. i traveled to stay at d.c. in mr.anthony's home. it was a great experience. we had a good time he was really nice and was a great host. everything was clean and great area i personally think. thanks 4 allowing me aswell as my friends to stay
4002,29082,2010-03-11,90314,Lee,"i recently stayed at anthony's place, originally for a 2 night stay, but ended up needing to stay an extra night, anthony was very accomadating in fulfilling my request. i am new to the airbnb site and this is the first rental i have done through the site, and i must say that i am overly satisfied with the entire experience. the value of having an entire 2 bedroom apartment, for less than the cost of a 2 star hotel was the kicker. anthony was very attentive to our needs & went out of his way to accomodate me. on my last day in town he even went as far as to allow me to stay past check out time at no additional charge to work out a couple of issues that needed to be taken care of before i could start my trip home. the next time i'm in the area, which should be pretty soon, i will definitely be checking to see if anthony's place is available again. looking forward to my next stay near the dc area... thanks anthony, you truly are at the top of my list of places i like to stay when traveling.... "
4002,32660,2010-04-01,87774,Denise,"anthony and his mom give a new meaning to southern hospitality, i was invited to dinner on my first night, he even went out of his way to pick me up when i got stranded first night there. the apartment is beautiful, clean and comfortable. it had everything we could have needed and wanted. the commute to downtown dc was sinmple and close to all public transportation. it made my 4 days there easy and pleasant. i would book with them again for ym next trip to dc without hesitation. thank you for such a warn welcome and wonderful experiance for my first airbnb stay."
4002,33200,2010-04-04,60242,Andrew,thank you anthony for your hospitality! my family and i appreciated staying at your private suite!
4002,34778,2010-04-11,80351,Jane,"anthony and his mother were extremely gracious hosts. we are a travelling couple from new zealand, and were extremely impressed at anthony's accommodating nature. he went out of his way to offer advice on the best things to do in washington, and told us to call if we ever needed help. and when the worst happened and i realized 200 miles from washington i had left my cell phone behind, i contacted anthony who kindly said he would mail it out to our next destination asap. would definitely recommend. nice spacious, private place. great for the traveller who wants a bigger place than your standard hotel!  "
4002,36036,2010-04-17,74565,Angela,"anthony was a great host - he even offered to pick us up from the airport in the late evening.  it was easy to get around rte 4 bus and the redline  metro at brookland station will get you where you need to go. and if you run later than the last bus it is an easy walk up michigan about a mile from the metro through pleasant neighborhoods. i did leave some maps and bus schedules to help others plan their days easier around the next bus. it is a good idea to be out for the #4 bus 10 minutes early in case it shows up early (depends on the driver).  anthony's place is a quiet neighborhood, comfortable bed, convenient washer/dryer, and plenty of seating for a family or to stretch out. i plan on coming back! "
4002,37820,2010-04-25,67016,Meg,"we had the pleasure of staying three nights at anthony's place. situated in a nice residential neighborhood, we particularly enjoyed that we had lots of space as opposed to staying in a cramped hotel room.   our teenage daughter liked the fact that she had her own room. the beds were very comfortable and the living quarters pleasant.    we would definitely book with anthony again. "
4002,41604,2010-05-11,87892,Aaron,"the apartment was very cozy. the beds were quite comfortable. it was better than staying in a hotel. street parking is available. easy access to bus, grocery stores, shopping mall. we would like to stay here again."
4002,42286,2010-05-14,108849,Carolina,"i agree with all the good things other people have already said: nice big appartment, very comfortable and clean, with a bus stop almost by the front door, or a nice walk to the metro in a peaceful neirbourhood. this was our first experience with airbnb so i don't have much comparing material, but i'd recommend this place: we were very happy with our choice :-)"
4002,44552,2010-05-21,70341,Jennet,anthony's place was perfect for us. it was much more spacious than the pictures show. good size rooms. anthony was very helpful with any questions we had about the area. nice neighborhood. this was our first experience with airbnb and anthony's place convinced us that this is the way to go! thank you anthony!
4002,46820,2010-05-27,116973,Helena,"we enjoyed staying at anthony. he is very nice person and he helped us with advices. the only thing we would like to have is stove and some pots (as we like to prepare meals).
we also like washington very much and we hope to come again.
"
4002,71328,2010-07-31,109608,Randy And Marivel,"this is our first time in using airbnb. thanks anthony for lovely stay at your place. those flashlights were helpful when we did not have power from a strong thunderstorm. condo stayed cool throughout the night even though it was humid outside!!. our stay was memorable!!  the kids enjoyed and felt they were at home. r4 bus to the red line brookland station was very accesible. remember that weekends and after rush hour r4 bus is every 30 minutes. during rush hour it is every 15 minutes. be prepared if you forget r4 bus. wifi was not working at the time but anthony made sure to fix it!!
thanks anthony for a great stay in dc!!"
4002,74004,2010-08-05,156678,Nathan,"anthony was very helpful when we arrived. he spent time answering our questions about the area. he even walked us to the bus stop near his home to help us get acquinted with the area. 

it was very nice to have the washer/dryer combo.

the negative we found was that we had no cell phone reception while in our rental.

overall it was a comfortable place to stay. it felt as if you were at your parent's home. our children enjoyed the board games and fooseball.

 my children would like to say hi to anthony. we thank you for our stay.

4002,76694,2010-08-11,129446,Grace,thank you anthony for being such a wonderfull host. grace
4002,79262,2010-08-16,120375,Tara,"staying with anthony was a pleasure. he was helpful and attentive while we were staying with him. more than once he went out of his way to help us by taking us to the supermarket and taking us to the greyhound station. 

the condo is spacious and has everything you could need while you're staying there. there was plenty of room for the five of us! 

you are within walking distance of the red line and supermarkets which is extremely convenient. on the whole a pleasurable experience."
4002,83772,2010-08-24,140844,Françoise,we enjoy staying at anthony's (website hidden by airbnb) was very hot outside and we appreciate to have cool inside .very convenient for 5 persons .anthony is very sympatic .
4002,96603,2010-09-14,93262,Loraine,"tony, we were pleased with our stay, plenty of room, quiet, clean and comfortable, just what we wanted for our vacation. after being out all day it was nice to have a your  place to come home to, thank you"
4002,102854,2010-09-22,218025,June,"anthony was very helpful when we arrived. he spent time answering all our questions about the area and the apartment and even drove us to supermarket to do some shopping. 

the apartment had everything we needed.  wireless internet was great and worked well.  lovely, clean towels and bed linen.

bus route was close by and got us to the metro in a few minutes.

we had some difficulty with the toaster and a vacuum cleaner would have been useful to help keep the apartment clean during our stay.  but overall, we had a great stay and really enjoyed washington from the comfort of this apartment."
4002,105188,2010-09-26,126187,Kathy,"we had very enjoyable stay in anthony's (website hidden by airbnb) apartment was clean, quiet and with easy access to the city via public transport. also being a basement apartment was very cool and comfortable after a particularly hot few days in the city. many thanks anthony for all your help and being so easy to deal with.

4002,131043,2010-11-01,241365,Jenna,"i had a great time at anthony's place. it was huge, clean, and very comfortable. it was extremely convenient to transit, and generally a pleasure to be at. very homey, very convenient, and a very good price! "
4002,134271,2010-11-06,266891,Ashley,"anthony was a swell host. the place was clean, private and we always felt safe. very close to the bus. we didn't get a chance to talk to him much but he left us a goody basket, which was just lovely. overall it was a great experience and a fantastic deal for the price! "
4002,140764,2010-11-17,268320,Pamela,"great host, and a great condo. very convenient to downtown, helped save on meal costs, and much more affordable than two hotel rooms. just what we needed."
4002,164442,2011-01-03,211612,Samuel,"anthony was great! and his place was great for my family. great space, private warm neighborhood, clean and hospitable. and on sunday, there's church services across the street. can't beat that.  a hotel has no comparison the this family experience.we really enjoyed ourselves. i highly recommend anthony's condo suite! thanks anthony! god bless!"
4002,191250,2011-03-02,360360,David,"anthony is a wonderful host and the unit was spacious, clean, conveniently located and affordable.  i recommend mr. evans as a reliable and kind host. "
4002,230306,2011-04-18,461434,Robert,"anthony greeted us personally despite our 6 hour late arrival. he even had some treats to welcome us and some things for breakfast. he was a good host and did his best to assist us with our need for info.

the space we rented was clean and neat. it is obvious he has made extra efforts to ensure comfort of guests. he has 3 tvs, washer and dryer, cooking appliances and nice bedding.

the basement unit is a basement unit in an older property so don't expect new and modern. please do expect a nice host, clean living space with the amenities you would most likely have at home

the transportation to the national mall is the bus and metro which at first may seem some what intimedating but after one trip you'll appreciate the cost and eficientcy  of the dc system.

overall this is a good value for a clean ,comfortable stay close to dc attractions. thanks anthony for making it available."
4002,261167,2011-05-12,484518,Ben,"anthony was a really great, we were running really late to our check in, and he waited up to greet us.  the place is really nice, clean and in a safe part of town.  i highly recommend anthony as a host!"
4002,263332,2011-05-14,532013,Nik Ahmad Munawwar,we didn't get to meet anthony but his place was spacious and well equipped. anthony handled us professionally.
4002,269110,2011-05-18,401410,Susan,"i stayed in this apartment when i was down in the area attending a wedding and site seeing, it was clean and close to supermarkets. it was nothing fancy but it worked well and was cheaper than staying in a hotel. the host was very easy to work with"
4002,274321,2011-05-22,358795,Dale,anthony is a great host!  he was very helpful in assisting us in getting our bearings so we could have a great stay!

4002,321922,2011-06-19,539260,Marianne,"clean, close to metro,town and markets.  nice, concerned and friendly neighbors. anthony was an attentive host."
4002,330339,2011-06-23,654043,Lydia,"anthony is a good host, very responsive to emails and questions, and made a good effort to make sure we had a pleasant stay. the location is about 20 minute drive from the mall. the only downside is that there's only an electric stove that cooks slowly, instead of an actual gas stove. overall we had a good stay and really enjoyed dc, i would definitely recommend this host."
4002,343676,2011-06-30,433466,Martin,"anthony's place is great, far bigger than imagined and a real treat to come and stay in, our host is a great guy, a real gentleman and would recommend anyone to come stay in the appartment. it is in a good location not far from the centre of washington, the appartment is spotlessly clean, much bigger than first thought and simply a great place to stay... enjoy yourselves there."
4002,360694,2011-07-08,672642,Thomas,"anthony greeted us personally. he stocked the place with some treats which our kids thought was really cool.  the place was clean and neat.   we used the washer and dryer every day.  remember that it is a basement of an older house.  there is a metro station nearby.  the kids were happy that we rode the metro a few times each day.  overall this is a good value for a clean, comfortable stay in dc.  it was more affordable than a hotel would have been with our group of six."
4002,375449,2011-07-16,464041,Mick,"anthony was great, a couple of small problems fixed right away. couldnt have been more helpful took us to the shops for food the first day we arrived, treated us like family. would recommendstaying here it was a great experience."
4002,386517,2011-07-21,149793,Richard,"hello, just sorry we didn't came to see anthony himself.
the condo was great. everything you possible needed was available.
it was overall a great place to stay. buslines just around the corner. and honestly, washington has the best public transport i've seen till now.
hello anthony"
4002,415022,2011-08-02,303619,Corinthias,"anthony was very attentive to our needs during our stay. you get what you see which is a older home that is clean and neat. the location is great within minutes from downtown. if your planning to visit dc, then i would recommend staying here. "
4002,420459,2011-08-04,861602,David,"we really enjoyed our stay at anthony's condo, which was clean, spacious and welcoming. the neighborhood was quiet and there was plenty of parking. there are several park-and-ride metro locations within a few miles from the condo, which made traveling around washington quite easy. 

anthony was super-fast in responding to any questions we had while making our reservations, and was communicative with us throughout our stay. i'd highly recommend anthony's condo for anyone visiting washington dc."
4002,467672,2011-08-22,852643,Renaud,"very nice place, thank you !"
4002,481383,2011-08-28,872137,David,"anthony's apartment is clean, quiet, spacious and in a part of dc in which i felt very safe.  he was very responsive in responding to emails and phone calls when we had questions.  we never actually met anthony, though he was home upstairs if we had needed him. this is not a 4 star hotel so don't expect a fancy polished look and feel ... it's a basement that has been converted into an apartment.  we were visiting at catholic university of america, so this could not have been a better location, just a 5 minute drive even with morning traffic.   the location is just a few houses off a major street, so if you don't want to drive your car into dc, i'm sure there is easy bus service to connect to the nearby cua metro stop, though we didn't use it.  anthony's place is especially perfect if you have a family and want to be able to have a bit more room than a hotel to relax and eat some meals at, instead of being crammed into a hotel and having to eat at restaurants all the time.
we will not hesitate to stay here again when the need arises."
4002,539380,2011-09-17,958945,Brian,"what a large place for just one person! it was precisely as described before i booked the place and anthony was very easy to deal with. a bus about 100 yeards away makes it very convenient during the day and after about nine at night there a safe one mile walk from the nearest station. the kitchen, in fact the whole house is extremely well equipped."
4002,564778,2011-09-25,819661,Herbert,we enjoyed our stay in washington.  anthony's place was clean and he was very helpful with us not having gps and being lost in washington trying to find the apartment at 9:30 at night.  the next day we purchased a gps and negotiated our travels much better.  thanks again anthony we will definitely consider your apartment should be return to washington in the future.
4002,611247,2011-10-09,860135,Glen,"we arrived at the condo but were unable to get in and had to wait for an hour for someone to let us in. when anthony arrived he was helpful and apologetic.
we found the condo comfortable and spacious. the bed was very comfortable.
the added touches of the supplies that were left were very warmly welcomed as we had a long journey from london and did not have time to do the shopping.
we found it more convenient to walk to the metro rather than wait for the bus which were infrequent. the walk took us 20 minutes and as the weather was beautiful, we found the walk pleasant and relaxing.
we had a couple of problems with the electrics but anthony and his mother sorted them out promptly.
we found the cooker difficult to use as it was slow to heat water for tea/coffee but anthony did his best to make it okay. it would have been difficult to cook anything as the stove was very slow.
we were lucky to spend time with anthony and his friend kellie and really enjoyed our conversations with them both, over a cup of tea.
anthony is a lovely and caring host and made our stay really memorable and enjoyable. we love washington.
we found grocery shopping difficult, as we didn't have a car. however there  is a local shop which was okay but quite pricy.
anthony was kind enough to offer to buy groceries.
thank you anthony for a lovely stay."
4002,677999,2011-11-01,535356,Annie,"my 3 school friends, boyfriend, and i were in town for a wedding. we picked anthony's place because it was <1 mile from the wedding venue and he has the best reviews on airbnb. anthony absolutely lived up to his reviews - - the place is clean, cozy, quiet, and a perfect space for larger parties (5+ pax). plenty of street parking and other amenities. "
4002,726005,2011-11-17,1242085,Catherine,"four of us comfortably stayed in this apartment for four nights while attending a conference. the beds were very comfortable, we had no trouble using the wireless internet or using the television. the price was great for the space and amenities. my only complaint is that it is a bit far from the downtown area. if you have a car it is very convenient but if you are relying on public transit you will likely have to take a bus and the metro. the dc buses are not very reliable or fast. the apartment was great and anthony evans was very attentive and communicative. i would recommend this place to friends visiting dc, but i would also suggest they rent a car while in the area. "
4002,758831,2011-12-02,67073,Lynne,this is a great place. it was warm(we visited in november) and quiet.the bed was very comfortable. it is just around the corner to the metrobus which takes you right to the metro. an added bonus is that there is a fun mexican market and a chineses take out across the street.
4002,855124,2012-01-10,1517165,Darryl,"what a great little place.  only 15 minutes or so from the capitol.
the house is well appointed, warm, all the ammenities including a washer & dryer.  the rooms were spacious & the beds very comfortable.  even the fold out bed was great.
i would have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone.  anthony was very personable, available for the tiniest enquiry."
4002,989791,2012-03-12,1160846,Andrea,"me and my friend stayed at this house for a month. the house is very spacious for two people. everything is either already there or nearby. one of our favorite things about this place were its location. (bus stop 30 seconds away to take you to the downtown). grocery store is 15 mins walk which we enjoyed also. 
house is very clean, and everything in good working condition. (fridge, toaster, hot water, etc.)
mr. evans always heard us when we asked something. he is a very kind and caring person. i would definitely stay here again when i need to visit dc again."
4002,1032809,2012-03-22,1907403,Igor,"anthony is a very good host, there were 4 of us in his flat and we had a good time. he left some food for us which was very nice. i would come back again to his flat if i need to rent a flat in washington."
4002,1162837,2012-04-22,1793956,Simone,"anthony’s place is a reasonable place to stay if you’re on a budget and can’t afford to stay at a hotel especially if you’re traveling as a group and would like to have your privacy; you have your own room instead of sharing a room with two beds with friends. the place is clean and spacious; each room has a tv which is good you don’t have to fight over the remote control to watch your favorite show. the apartment is in the basement but i didn’t know until i got there i was a little disappointed. maybe if i knew in advance it would be different. i got comfortable after a while because it’s a clean place. one thing i didn’t like is that there was no stove, i stayed there for a week i had plan to cook so i could save money but i couldn’t. the apartment has a two burner stove that can be used on top of the counter, however it takes a lot of patience to cook on it maybe that can be changed.

overall, it’s not a bad place, i like that the national shrine of immaculate conception is not too far i had a chance to visit it. anthony was very nice responding to my questions when i was looking for a place to stay. 
"
4002,1186570,2012-04-26,2115294,Jessica,our family loved anthony's place.  it was spacious and very private.   he was nice enough to drive us to the grocery for our supplies during our 3 day stay.  the bus ride and metro was no hassle except if you arrive late where the bus schedule becomes hourly.  the stay was really great except for the cold weather.  we would definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back to stay if we visit the area again.  
4002,1226050,2012-05-04,2015029,Wai,"anthony has been a great host. i have felt the hospitality of anthony when he first picked me up from the metro station to his house because the bus is not running frequently. 
anthony's place is very convenient to travel from point to point. the bus stop is right at the corner and the metro station is just one bus stop away. it only takes about 20 minutes to get to smithsonian area. supermarkets and shops are around as well. 
the place is like our house. we have the whole basement to ourselves. we enjoyed the tv channels that anthony installed. it's easy to cook our own food. it has been a great place overall. i would definitely recommend to anyone who is willing to spend time in dc. 
thanks anthony for being a great host, 
wai & family
"
4002,1243511,2012-05-07,2253260,John,"we did not stay at all. the whols booking arrangements were a shambles as we had never wanted to use this condo as it was too far out. the reason it appeared on the screen was that while we tried for so long to place a photograph for another place this two bedroom condo appeared but we never intended to book it.
we arrived at it by taxi and found the area unsuitable - the taxi driver said we should not stay as it would not be safe at night. also the outside of the property was in poor state of repair and the basement from the outside was not attractive. the owner was not there though he had sent an e-mail which did not arrive in time with the lock no. for self entry.
i should add that in communication with our proposed host he was more than courteous.
john matthews
i could not undo the stars which filled out as i touched the screen."
4002,1274975,2012-05-14,1733817,Marcio,"the condo looks exactly like the pictures depict. it really felt like home for the full week in which we stayed there, we were only two but the condo can easily host 5 or more people. we really loved the fact that it was equipped with all appliances such as a stove, kettle, etc which meant we could cook anything we liked on the days we decided to stay at home. the beds are as comfortable as anthony describes them, i really slept comfortably during my stay. anthony was very friendly and even though we arrived really late at night he ensured that we managed to find the place alright. i recommend the condo to anyone visiting dc. "
4002,1316408,2012-05-21,2093523,Joan,"anthony is a great! the place was as he described and if you are only looking for a place to rest at the end of a full day in dc - anthony's basement will do! it is not spic and span though since it is full of old furniture and knick knacks-
we were 3 adults and 3 kids- we fit perfectly in the 2 bedrooms and the fold out bed in the living room. the drawback for me is there is only 1 bathroom (i knew this when i booked though)- the tub in the bathroom was cracked but anthony is replacinrg it soon.
we had a problem with the burner in the kitchen and anthony replaced it right away.  
advise to next guests: check out the kitchen and bathroom cabinets before you go grocery shopping! there are things you can use:-)
"
4002,1357174,2012-05-27,2214467,Donna,"thanks anthony your help got us in to the condo.  we enjoyed our stay, the condo had everything we needed.  would recommend anyone to stay."
4002,1403928,2012-06-03,1812826,Leif,we stayed at anthony’s apartment for 4 nights. it was a nice apartment with good communications to the city. 100 meters to the bus and 10 minutes drive to the subway station. very convenient! thank you for a great stay.
4002,1526228,2012-06-20,2320808,Deb,"for a basement condo (with poor air flow), the description of this place is too optimistic! i am even surprised that this unit meets the regulatory requirement to rent out this place given a cracked bathtub, spiders, wires hanging out in bedroom, no humidifier run in basement unit). i stayed because i had no other options!!! 

anthony should state in the subject line (and not just in the description) that this is a basement condo. this information is key for asthma patients as was our case. the air quality was poor at best. it seemed the humidifier was not run during our entire stay (anthony did not even mention that he had a working humidifier even though we complained of poor air quality!) i was sick for a week after my return from dc. he says in his description ""just bring your toothbrush!"". that's far from the truth. he offered us stale oats (left over by some other guest). we said no thanks! 

i had no issues with the neighborhood as such but hi unit lacks maintainance and upkeep to be rented out for money!!!! 

1. the unit and its furniture were shabby and looked like hand me downs (mistmatched chairs, broken knobs etc.)
2. the shower tub had a crack in it (when asked anthony said he was aware of this but did not repair it!)
3. wires were cticking out of the bedroom wall 
4. there were spiders in the kitchen
5. humidier was not run during our stay which made the basement dingy and claustrophobic: i mentioned this to him and he said said he had the ability to turn air-conditioning on/off remotely.
6. the a/c would turn off early morning, making the unit dingy.
7. he took additional cash from me when i arrived with more members than what i had listed online! i had mentioned that this could be a possibility."
4002,1802697,2012-07-26,2039663,Bruce,"this was a great choice for us. having 2 bedrooms and extra sofa sleepers made it so much more pleasant travelling with two children. room was comfortable and easy to get to. travelling to downtown dc wasn't a big deal and even including parking it was much cheaper than staying downtown.

beds were very comfortable and multiple tvs were nice. it's not a fancy place but if you're looking for comfort and space at an affordable price this is a great choice in our opinion and anthony is a great host."
4002,1820264,2012-07-28,2729323,Charlie,"very nice and quite place to stay, so many churches surround it, easy commute to capital/white house.  grocery store across the street, easy/safe street parking.

we love the this place!"
4002,1888323,2012-08-04,3068150,Shandell,"i rented this past week at anthonys place. the place itslef is basic . there is a living room area when you first walk in with alot of water damage and bad areas. ideally mr. anthonys place needs to be closed as to the many health concerns in mr. anthonys basement apartment. this experience was absolutely crazy. the first night or two was fine. no complaints really. until my personal things around the property started to disappear randomly... when i should have been the only one with acces to the place!! come to find out he has family living on the site upstairs . those people have access to the basement all though the door is locked there are keys. i lost over 200 dollars in cash and 2transactions magically appeared on my account. i called mr. anothony asap and he was extermely disrespectful and unkind. he shows up to the property minutes later fuming ,telling me i can leave instead of listening to my concerns and properly handling the situation. he has cameras all around the property that  watch the activity around the place. at this time i still had already paid for another night and my safety was at risk because if people im unaware of have access to the property anything could happen! he apparently left work . he was very disrespectful sarcastic and childish about the situation. he would not show me the videos of the property to assure me of my safety !! i begged and pleaded explained and went on and mr. anothny did nothing to make me feel better or comfortable with the situation. i ended up calling the poliece and filling out a police report on mr anthony and his property. i took the neccessary pictures of the damages and safety hazzards as instructed by the officers who came and did the walk through of the property of his place and he will be shut down dealing with my kind . honestly, nobody else should have to go through what i did. also befroe calling the police me and anothny somewhat came to an agreement. he asked me if i needed a free night and that he would be contacting airbnb to assist me with finding a new property . the next day mr anthony arrives at the property without contacting me with another guy telling me i need to leave. none the less i left but not until the poliece came again. im not from dc. im from richmond im here for an internship. i could not just get up and go because i dont know anybody here or where to go. mr anthony was a terrible host . i would never rent from him again and i would never reccomend any of my fellow airbnb travelrs book with him as he need extensive help with his attitude and his customer service skills. first rule in customer service: the customer is alwasys rightt!? dosent seem to matter much to him.  i left his place yesterday. today is august 7th 2012 and this is the most up to date review. "
4002,4897251,2013-05-31,6607503,Erica,"my husband and i stayed at this condo for two nights while on a brief visit from nyc. as guests, we enjoyed the coziness and intimacy of this b&b experience. this condo was perfect for us! there was a lot of space and the place was in a great location. the space was clean and well organized much like the pictures and description. the only thing different from the pictures were that there were two new sleep sofas in the living room area which added a nice touch to the space. the place was in good shape and above all it was a very comfortable and cozy stay with plenty of amenities that made us feel at home.  it is also conveniently located near a bus stop and metro station; we felt quite safe and comfortable in the neighborhood.  on top of it all, anthony was the consummate host. he prepared for our stay in a timely and organized manner. he was also great with responding to our questions. anthony was very personable and accommodating to our needs. it was just the kind of hospitality we needed after a long and frazzled travel experience.  my husband and i would definitely stay here again whenever we are in town."
4002,5440034,2013-06-30,6786415,Gerardo,"this is a great place located in a fairly pleasant neighborhood.  anthony was accommodating and very friendly towards all of us.  perfect for temporarily staying near d.c. while having ready access to many places in the surrounding areas.

4002,5836216,2013-07-18,7398409,Andi,"thank you ,place was great ,anthony is a good host ,we do have fun in dc , everything was perfect"
4002,6637138,2013-08-19,7119882,Peter,"anthony's place fit our needs very nicely.  it was clean, a good value, spacious and had plenty of sleeping accommodations for our entire group of 5.  the shower was fantastic. great water pressure!

the condo is very secure with two locking doors each with modern key-less entry.  

we didn't use the washer/dryer but it was great to have the option!

we cooked several meals there over the course of our stay and the large fridge/ freezer and cookware helped save some $ from having to eat out every meal.  

anthony also helped solve a mix-up in the original booking which was super helpful! thanks"
4002,7334336,2013-09-16,5679353,Ron,"anthony’s place served us well for our large party of 6 (3 adults, 2 babies and 1 toddler).  the place is very spacious with tv and cable available in all rooms. the washer/dryer was a big bonus and easy to operate.  commute to metro center (red line) was quick and easy if you time the r4 bus right - about 20 minutes.  there’s a dollar tree across the street that has some frozen foods, juice, snacks and even eggs!  we did find the floor was a bit dirty for crawling babies upon arrival but anthony was quick to provide a broom and mop for us to give the floors a once over before letting the babies loose.  overall it was a great experience and would consider again."
4002,7705117,2013-09-30,8516906,Alison,"i stayed with a group of five of us all together. we came in from upstate new york about 7+ hours away. we were vendors for the washington paper's annual crafty bastards craft show. my husband and a friend got in earlier and they were able to meet anthony. they said he was  really nice and very accommodating. 

when my two friends and i came in much later, and we were able to go to bed right away. i stayed on one of the sofa beds with my husband and i have to say, it was very comfortable. 

the drive to the show was literally fifteen minutes and had no traffic to contend with. 

after a long day of selling, we came back and it was nice to be able to relax, watch a little television and go to bed. 

there were lots of perks about the condo itself. it is cozy but you don't feel claustrophobic. the shower water pressure is great, and we were able to make food on the hot plate. 

checkout was simple the next day. we grabbed our stuff, locked up, and were on our way to day 2 of the show. 

i would definitely stay at the condo again, i felt like it had all perks and no cons. the pricing was so much better than any of the other places we were looking at. anthony is a wonderful host, and he really did everything to make us feel welcomed. "
4002,8367200,2013-10-28,8254195,Rachelle,beautiful apartment near all the attractions of dc. clean and big house. we enjoyed our stay for 3 days.

4501,1093,2009-03-26,9262,Erica,"the location was really convenient (a very short walk from the shaw-howard u metro station), the hosts seemed really nice, the room was clean, comfy bed, tv, etc. and it was all quite easy in terms of booking, payment, arrival, and departure. a great alternative to a pricey downtown hotel, i fully recommend it.

"
4501,3727,2009-06-08,13380,Mel,"this was quite possibly one of the best 'lodging' situations i have ever had: the house was impeccably clean, the bed was magically comfortable, the towels were soft and fresh...the only difference it had from a boutique hotel room was the enormous price-tag attached!  it would behoove you to stay here while on stay in dc, really there are no better accomodations!

4501,6047,2009-07-24,25602,Kelly,my first time using airbnb - i stayed at kip & liz' house in dc for 3 nights on business and it was a great alternative to pricey hotels.  the bedroom & bathroom were small but very clean and had everything i needed.  very convenient to the metro.  kip was a gracious host.  thanks!
4501,6276,2009-07-28,18090,Jeff,"i could not have hoped for a better experience for my first stay in d.c.  i was in town for a conference at the washington convention center, and kip & liz's cozy and inviting row house made it an easy walk.  the metro stop was also ridiculously close and like a magic doorway to the whole city.  kip & liz are close to groceries (including whole foods), and don't miss ben's chili bowl, and meridian hill park, both are within walking distance.  kip is a great host (sorry i missed liz).  i'd definitely go back!

me senti muy comodo y como en mi casa desde el momento en que llegue. 
sin dudas volveria estar ahi, ellos reciben gente en su casa y saben como hacerlo!!

4501,41336,2010-05-10,75004,Diana,"really nice people, i couldn't have asked for nicer more welcoming, informative hosts. the room was clean and bed cosy. it is near the metro. the area is a mix of revitalized rowhouses and businesses. there are some boarded up storefronts and areas still waiting to be revitalized a few blocks away, so coming home at night i chose my route. "
4501,42224,2010-05-14,90081,Lorraine,"i can only repeat what everyone else has said.  kip and liz are a gorgeous couple, their house is lovely and inviting.  the bed was as comfy as my own so i had no problems sleeping, and i am a very light sleeper :) the bathroom was great, liz was kind enough to let me use her hairdryer so i didnt have to drag mine halfway across the world. it was nice to have the run of the house rather than the confines of a hotel room.

i had no problems getting to the metro thanks to kip's directions, and it is an easy 2 stop ride to downtown washington.

this was my first airbnb experience and thanks to kip and liz i would not hesitate to stay with them again."
4501,44200,2010-05-20,85138,Pam,great couple!!!  their place is definitelty close to the metro.  this is our first experience using this company and our stay with kip and liz will ensure future bookings thru airbnb.  all accomindations were as expected and as kip and liz described!  thanks again you guys for making our stay perfect!

4501,74645,2010-08-06,183055,Kate,"i enjoyed my stay at kip and liz's house. very clean, very comfortable and the metro is insanely close. blackout shades in the bedroom would have helped keep the room darker in the morning -- but i'm a late sleeper who's sensitive to light. they live on a nice block. that said, i was a little nervous walking home at night by myself.

thanks guys, a perfect base to explore the city!"
4501,114175,2010-10-08,219108,Elsa,"kip and liz hosted my parents for one week. they are very nice and gave them city's maps and adviced them for their visits. their place is really nice, near from u street, the metro, and groceries. they weren't home a lot so my parents could stay in the living room and use the kitchen as they wanted. they have also a little garden.
i recommend this place !"

the room was clean and private and the bed was perfect. 

i'd highly recommend staying with this stellar couple. it made my trip to dc all the more enjoyable having a beautiful home to stay at, friendly guides to offer advice and even a little carry away granola snack to make it through an arduous conference.   "

4501,151433,2010-12-09,270046,Erich,this was a great place to stay - very close to the howard metro station.  very comfortable private room.  great host in kip.  look forward to staying there again soon.
4501,168023,2011-01-08,328140,Joseph,"kip and liz are warm, gracious, and generous hosts.  i can't imagine anyone not enjoying a fabulous dc experience with their hospitality and genuine concern for and interest in their guests.  by the end of my stay, i felt as if i had been visiting old friends who had welcomed me into their home."
4501,173630,2011-01-23,316251,Jennifer,"kip and liz were excellent hosts - the room was a perfect size for 1 person, and the location is simply perfect for anyone traveling for a conference at the convention center. i would definitely stay with kip and liz again!"
4501,178542,2011-02-05,352069,Nick,"kip and liz were fantastic hosts, very fun, inviting and accommodating.  they have a beautiful house in a great neighborhood.  good proximity to a lot of different attractions, and the bed is sooooo comfy."
4501,179223,2011-02-07,349956,Jennifer,the dc row house was my refuge during a very busy weekend.  it was exactly as pictured & indeed a short jaunt to the metro which made all the difference.  perhaps more importantly liz (whom i confess i never met; i heard her sneeze once or twice & that was it) and kip were utterly responsible & dependable.  they communicated clearly & consistently in advance & followed through on everything from start to finish in a most efficient manner.   although we had very little contact in person i still felt warmly welcomed by them & yet at the same time always felt my space was being respected.   
4501,197383,2011-03-12,411415,Bea,"kip and liz are just as great as all the reviews suggest! room's a bit tight,  but, these two are really delightful and knowledge guides and it is darn convenient. i recommend it! "
4501,210755,2011-03-28,393902,Robin,"this was exactly what i needed. the room is cozy, the bed is comfortable, and the bathroom is clean. kip and liz are great hosts! they were friendly and very knowledgable with great information about dc. the location is perfect too, 1.5 blocks from the metro made my commute to the center of dc really short. i enjoyed getting to know the u street corridor and look forward to trying even more of the restaurants and music venues in the near neighborhood. "
4501,214716,2011-04-01,457162,Jessica,extremely great hosts that are fun to talk to and are willing to give you suggestions for your trip to dc.  i highly recommend them.
4501,220719,2011-04-08,457162,Jessica,second time i have stayed here.  always a pleasure!
4501,227681,2011-04-16,391927,Gilad,"for the little time i spent at kip&liz's house, i had a great time!
only got to meet liz when i was there and she was exremely nice.
the house is beautiful and the room is very comfortable, great bed!

its located very close to the mile. there is a train station like 2 minutes away, and its 5 minutes by train to get to the mile.

highly reocommended!"
4501,235312,2011-04-22,457162,Jessica,"this is my 3rd stay here.  as always, great people and great place.  i wish i had more time to enjoy it than i do with work!

- jessica"
4501,245633,2011-04-30,457162,Jessica,great again!  i love going back to this place.  a real haven.
4501,251078,2011-05-04,455166,Ruth,"great location, safe neighborhood, spacious and clean. warm friendly hosts that are well prepared. would definitely stay here again in the future. "
4501,262410,2011-05-13,509289,Joanne & Chris,"kip and liz were amazing hosts, very friendly and welcoming.  house is lovely, very clean and great location.  we liked dc a lot and were glad we made the trip.  thanks both, we had a fantastic stay.  jo and chris"
4501,272516,2011-05-20,457162,Jessica,always a pleasure...i have been here 4 to 5 times and they are great hosts
4501,283737,2011-05-27,457162,Jessica,kip and liz were great hosts again.  i have loved staying with them over the past few months.  i would stay there again in a heartbeat.
4501,295917,2011-06-03,560092,Ricardo,"excellents hosts.well organized,clean and turist brochures provided.
location close to metro station.
they are nice people and well travelled that understand your needs as new in unknown city."
4501,298680,2011-06-05,472104,Tommy,these guys are awesome host! i was very nervous about staying in someone's place that i didn't know. they answered all of my questions before i arrived and seemed more than happy to help in my touring plans. their easy going manner put all of my issues with the process to rest where i could enjoy my stay. great location and a very nice pad! thanks a lot of the use of the room! would stay here again when i am in dc.
4501,309750,2011-06-12,517076,Olga,"the house and the room were great. very beautiful and clean. very nice and green backyard. location is perfect, its in a residential area although all the attractions are within the walkable distance. if you don't like to walk the metro is just a step behind. liz is extremely nice, friendly and helpful. she did everything for me to feel comfortable and enjoy the stay. highly recommended!!! nothing more to add, it was just perfect!"
4501,319369,2011-06-17,457162,Jessica,once again such a great place to stay!  its such a great place to stay that i almost want to give it a bad review so it is available more often :-p  just kidding.  you won't regret staying here.
4501,344101,2011-06-30,636815,Hila,great place!!! we enjoyed our visit very much!!!
4501,378100,2011-07-17,692046,Elizabeth,"excellent experience!  room was clean and quiet, and bed comfy.  great location with easy access to dc transportation and sites.  kip and liz are great hosts!"
4501,390781,2011-07-23,457162,Jessica,this is my favorite place to stay in dc.  i have been staying with airbnb every week since the end of march and i stayed with kip and liz whenever possible.  i highly recommend them!
4501,410496,2011-08-01,607317,Jennifer,"i really felt at home at kip & liz's place - i felt like i was visiting old friends!   my bedroom & bathroom were more than adequate; very comfortable and private.  they generously made coffee for me every day, and it was great having a place to park my car.  the location was really convenient for me, and the metro is just around the corner.  i'd definitely stay with them again if i return to d.c. anytime soon!"
4501,493106,2011-09-01,905960,Felicity,"kip and liz were great hosts - they were super friendly and welcoming. the room and bathroom were clean and nice (i found the metro map shower curtain particularly helpful). they are incredibly close to the metro and walking distance from lots of great food/entertainment options. they were also very flexible when i needed to stay an extra night. if i had not just rented my own house in dc, i would certainly stay here again."
4501,524071,2011-09-12,728170,Ulf,"my girlfriend and i stayed at liz & kip's place in the beginning of september 2011 for 3 nights and were really happy that we have found it. both are really helpful and fun to chat with. the location of their house is really cool, since there is a metro and bike rental station just around the corner. it seems to be a quiet neighborhood but bars and restaurants are only 2 blocks away. if you are looking for something to stay at in washington, this should be your first choice!"
4501,536669,2011-09-16,410682,Daniel,"kip and liz are fantastic hosts. the room and bathroom are private, clean and comfortable. location is great -- one block from the yellow or green line. would highly recommend to any visitor."
4501,561262,2011-09-23,1185551,Jeevanandham,"my stay at the dc rowhouse was clean, crisp and just what i needed. kip and liz knew exactly what i needed to know (and more, i'm sure) and they were very helpful! "
4501,569570,2011-09-26,73698,Val-Pierre,"love kip and liz - great people, great place. highly recommended."
4501,578971,2011-09-28,1162910,Kip,a fantastic home in an up-and-coming district of washington. i insisted on walking into town every time and it took about 20 minutes. the room was as good as any hotel i have stayed at - and i've stayed at some great hotels. kip and liz are both interesting and welcoming - i particularly liked the maps around the house. the ethiopian restaurants about three minutes away provided the best food i had in the us - the vegetarian savoury pancakes are highly recommended.
4501,671248,2011-10-28,1267401,Helen,"kip and liz made me feel very welcome in their comfortable home.
i stayed four nights - perfect sleep on a perfect bed - which my feet needed after walking around the sights in dc!.
they left tourist info for me which was a great help together with the fact that they are only a block away from the metro.  
they recommended a great restaurant nearby, ulah bistro.
lastly they have travelled a lot so i got all sorts of tips from them about se asia and latin america."
4501,705880,2011-11-09,772144,Stacey,"the location and room arrangements were perfect! the place tends to be a little dark, which made it hard to read or do work unless i was in the bedroom during the day. also, the breakfast options were limited (two cereals, bread, milk, and coffee). other than those things, i thought the hosts were welcoming and helped us navigate the area to find food and metro info. i would definitely recommend others to stay here, especially if you're single and/or traveling for fun."
4501,727614,2011-11-18,947927,Jon,"kip and liz were very accommodating, nice, and friendly.  their place is nicely renovated and clean. i would recommend them as hosts."
4501,873784,2012-01-20,65325,Kyle,kip and liz were wonderful hosts. i will be happy to stay in the row house for any future trips to dc. fun neighborhood for a youthful nightlife crowd.
4501,881778,2012-01-24,1553776,Rob,"kip and liz's house is beautiful and they're very nice people. the room was clean and comfortable. my arrangements with kip and liz were done last minute and they were very quick and effective communicators. if i'm back in the area, i'll definitely consider staying here again."
4501,3857636,2013-03-21,5347776,Julián,"i spent a whole week in kip and liz's house (march 2013). the house is really beautiful, the room and bathroom very good and clean too. the neighborhood is good and it is well located. besides, the house is one block away from the metro, which simplifies everything. kip and liz are really good hosts: they help you in case you need it, they respect your time and privacy, and they are very relaxed. they make you feel ease at home. "
4501,4129436,2013-04-12,4402248,Gemma,kip & liz are very welcoming and helpful! their house is very well taken care of and has a pleasant atmosphere. staying here really contributed to a great time in washington dc. i would definitely stay here again!
4501,4197665,2013-04-17,4651064,Marie,"i spent four really good days at kip and liz's place. their house is really beautiful and they were great hosts, friendly and very accomodating. they also gave me good advice on what to do in dc and where to eat and have a drink in the neighborhood. a very good experience!"
4501,4226115,2013-04-20,435777,Nurfarini,"the house was very easy to find and accessible to the metro, which was definitely helpful for a lone traveler like moi.  liz gave me all the tips getting to and fro their place and even if i only saw both of them for perhaps less than an hour in total, were very friendly and accommodating.  i also wished i had their jobs! :) 

both room and bathroom were clean and i always felt as if i had the house to myself even if they were around - tiptoeing about.

thanks kip and liz!"
4501,7405427,2013-09-18,8651686,Eva,"liz and kip were great hosts! they really made my transition to living in dc a lot easier. the rowhouse is beautiful and currently being filled with art, photos and memories from their 1.5 year long trip around the world. the location is very convenient (2min to shaw/howard u station), in an up-and coming area and the rooms  are comfortable. what i appreciated most was liz' and kip's flexibility, helpfulness and kindness. i ended up staying two more weeks...thanks a lot to both of you! ps. if you are lucky - liz will have the best home-made granola ready for you. "
4501,7469983,2013-09-21,8770288,Petra,"this was my first airbnb experience and kip and liz made it great! they are both warm and inviting people which i felt reflected in the atmosphere and cleanliness of their place. my room and bathroom were as described in the pictures - which worked well for me. this location is convenient with easy access to metros and for walking. i appreciated their clear and timely communications, before and during my stay. i found them to be great hosts in their level of friendliness and interactions - not too much or too little - just right with a joyful and gracious atmosphere :). i will be looking to stay here again on future trips! "
4501,7993359,2013-10-11,2809083,Alan,"great location, great hosts and welcoming accommodations.  in addition, kip and liz were very helpful.  would stay again."
4501,8175754,2013-10-19,3427889,Elizabeth,"kip and liz made me feel right at home from the start. they have lots of knowledge of the area and interesting stories and photographs depicting their travel around the world.
the bedroom is small and stark but quiet. the bathroom is tiny but functional. the location is in an up and coming neighborhood with lots of restaurants and clubs. a plus for me is being away from the tourists. dc is a great walking town and the location makes it possible to walk for miles taking in the history of the city. 
when i return to the area, i will first check for availability with kip and liz."
4501,8446006,2013-10-31,7985888,Stacy,"this was my first air bnb stay and it couldn't have been nicer. kip and liz are absolutely lovely and it was so great getting to know them. their house was very clean, the room was nice and quiet. they were very accommodating and helpful and gave me great info about washington dc. i recommend it very highly! i will definitely stay with kip and liz again on my next trip to dc."
4501,9198680,2013-12-12,3949012,Don,"kip and liz are fellow travelers - great, kind and interesting people to meet while on the journey.  i wish we had time to visit, but my schedule was business and not leisure. they have a nice and cozy home that is conveniently next to the metro which made all of dc easily in reach. i look forward to seeing them again somewhere on the path.

4967,133607,2010-11-04,270046,Erich,"great basement room with private bath - very well appointed.  beautiful large screen tv with all main channels - excellent personable host - easy access to metro bus/rail system.  i feel like in this review i'm doing a commercial for this place, but for real - it was great.  looking forward to staying there again soon."
4967,196339,2011-03-10,199218,Stijn,"seveer was so nice picking me up from the trainstation at night. his house is in a nice and central location. buses run direct to union city, a close walk to all the sight.

very clean , and nice play to stay when you are d.c !

"
4967,330615,2011-06-23,660326,Chanel,"seveer is a very friendly, resourceful and thoughtful host. miko the dog is sweet and well behaved. the apartment is clean and comfortable, and is located in an interesting and upcoming neighborhood. 

transportation to and from downtown is easy and accessible. there are grocery stores close by along with a number of ethnic restaurants.

my request was accepted by seveer at the last minute, even while his home was being remodeled and he had a lot going on - nonetheless, he was gracious and hospitable, and i really enjoyed being able to meet him and miko."
4967,636827,2011-10-17,1131222,Troy,"i had a great time staying at seveer's house.

the house is clean, well kept, and very nice.  it's recently remodeled, modern, and welcoming.  and your host is more than gracious in all things.  he's kind and very knowledgeable of the area and the city.

the neighborhood is great, too.  close to downtown, really close to h street, and easy walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the like.  there's plenty of public transportation options available, too.

all in all, i can't say enough good things about my time at seveer's home.  highly recommended!"
4967,728620,2011-11-18,1389258,Linda,"i loved my stay.  seveer is a great host - very thoughtful and accomodating.  i got the basement room with its own bath, and everything was attractively arranged to make for a convenient stay.  safe, friendly neighborhood, on street parking, 10 minutes from union station by bus.  best of all, the room has a large screen television and a fireplace style heater, so when i was at the house in the evening, i was very entertained and comfortable.  i also had a lot of privacy - there was another guest staying at the same time, and i never even saw him.  highly recommended."
4967,897328,2012-02-01,1308929,Adam,my stay couldn't have been any better.  seveer was an excellent host.  he even made me the best cream of wheat that i have ever had.  i will certainly return if i am in dc again.  five stars at a two stars price!
4967,920211,2012-02-13,590370,Gaspar,"nothing beats hospitality. not even 5 stars rate. i was extending my stay in washington dc at saveer's place and i made a right decision to stay at his place. 

he go extra mile to ensure your comfort. he picked me up at the metro and even drive me to the airport. what more can you ask from a host? i even get a bottle of beer from him for nothing.

he is a frequent traveller himself, hence he knows what it takes to delight his guess and his place is clean, neat and tidy. 

i will be back for my next visit to dc. you can bet on it."
4967,2609962,2012-10-14,137555,Alex,"great experience! the basement apartment was roomy, very clean, and comfortable and seveer was a great host.. overall, i'd definitely recommend."
4967,2664329,2012-10-20,3284413,Tony,"i was a recent guest with seveer and it was a very good experience and stay.  seveer is delightfully helpful and immediately showed me around the neighborhood to get comfortable with retail and transportation issues.  i stayed in the downstairs unit which was comfortable. there are no windows in this room but it did not bother me at all.  it has a murphy bed which is quite comfortable, large screen tv and a clean and modern bathroom.  seveer had a hot pot of coffee awaiting in the morning, which was nice.  there is a bus ride from his home to union station so that 10 1- 15 minutes needs to be factored in when traveling but it's an easy ride.  i'll be back for certain!"
4967,2700859,2012-10-24,3532393,Ram,"very nice guy, very polite and hospitable. went out of my way to make my trip comfortable.  well maintained house. definitely recommend his place."
4967,2784824,2012-11-02,3463066,Wolfgang,"seveer was a great host who helped me to come along very well with the unusual situation after storm ""sandy"" which had also affected the public life in d.c."
4967,3404356,2013-01-23,4742146,Kathleen,"i'll admit this was my first time using airbnb, and i was absolutely spoiled! it was easy to get to and the basement was comfortable and private.  and, of course, seveer is an amazing host!  he really went out of his way to make sure i knew my way around the area and had everything i needed."
4967,5302019,2013-06-23,6707501,Annas,"this was my first time using airbnb and i was pretty nervous about how it would turn out. luckily for me, seveer and his home were truly welcoming. the home is exceptionally beautiful, and seveer is an incredibly kind host. he makes sure that you're well adjusted to the home and the city. my stay was very comfortable. if i ever have to come back to dc, i know where i want to stay!"
4967,7879576,2013-10-07,8529808,Jabu,"i stayed a couple of weeks at ed a.k.a seveer's home in sept and oct 2013. i felt at home right from the time i got off the metro bus [d4], which is just in front of the entrance gate. ed and his friend angel [who used to come now and again] are great hosts, friendly, frank and above all very neat, hygienic and environmentally-conscious. on my first day, angel walked me around the neighbourhood and the following day ed drove me around to the shops. very kind of them, i must add.

the room upstairs (where i stayed) had a comfortable double size bed and satellite tv. it was also very spacious, quite, personal and clean. it also comes with an extra small ""study/closet"" room next to it, which i used mostly to work on my computer. ed allowed me to always use  the bathrooms (downstairs or  upstairs), laundry, kitchen, fridge, and at times share with me their food :-). he also cooked a number of times for us and his guests (who come once in a while). [just make sure you clean after yourself - dishes etc, he is particular about that]

overall, the house is quite stylish and well organized. the neighbourhood is also quite and safe. for transport, metro bus was the best option for me. i never had problems to get just about anywhere in dc from ed's house, shops are also closed by (walking distance).

i would definitely recommend his place and use it again when i am back in dc.
"
5589,11019,2009-09-22,14086,Julie,"great location and price. we had the whole apartment and ami was very helpful both before and during our visit, giving us lots of local information, maps etc and calling us to make sure everything was ok in the apartment. dupont circle metro is only a 20 minute walk away and there is a great harris teeter grocery store virtually around the corner which was fantastic. also, just around the corner was 18th street with a vast array of restaurants to suit every taste."
5589,23543,2010-01-07,62563,Margaret,"a delightful apartment, close to a huge range of restaurants and not far from the metro.  ami made us feel very welcome - a home away from home.  thank you ami. "
5589,27130,2010-02-21,77764,Cary,"our three-night stay at this great location was walking distance to adams morgan night life, the omni shoreham and marriott wardman hotel/conference centers, and grocery stores. our accommodations were better than any hotel i've ever stayed in without the extra cost, and the apartment (we used both rooms) came with a kitchen and closet space, and clean, comfortable everything, but not sterile, as hotel rooms usually are. ami was helpful with information about the area and even called to make sure we were comfortable and had no questions."
5589,27496,2010-02-24,80532,Delf,"i really enjoyed staying with ami. he was a great host offering me everything i needed (he is not only a good cook but also great ""tourist guide""). his appartement is very cozy and clean and located in a great neighbourhood full of nice restaurants and bars. full support!"
5589,32602,2010-04-01,32762,Grant,"great location in adams morgan. only two minutes walk to the action. typical bachelor pad, clean enough. ""basement cosy"" price about right."
5589,36224,2010-04-18,75997,Benjamin,"our stay at ami's was great.   the place was close to all the action and was conveniently located near both a grocery store and great restaurants/bars.

we had all the basics at the apartment and was just a super location for the conference we were attending and all the sightseeing we did.

thanks!"
5589,39302,2010-05-02,89613,Joy,"my friends and i had a wonderful stay at ami's place.  he was an extremely gracious host and offered several useful tips and suggestions (his recommendation of ""tryst"" for coffee was absolutely on the mark!).  his place is both convenient for people who are in town to conduct business and need a central location that is easy to get in and out of, but is also located in a neighborhood that is -- itself -- full of great shops and restaurants.  we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend it.  (even his neighbor is lovely -- she was very sweet about me interrupting her sunday morning to get the keys back since i had forgotten a bag.)"
5589,50162,2010-06-06,98692,Jess,"ami was an excellent host from beginning to end.  before leaving for dc, ami called to give us information about the apartment and see if i had any questions.  the apartment was in a great neighborhood, walking distance to many restaurants and stores including the u street corridor, dupont and the main street of adams morgan.  it was large and well-kept.  at no time were the 4 of us ever uncomfortable.  we were even able to find street parking right in front of the house. it is a basement apartment so there were a few problems with bugs, but that is to be expected.  overall, ami was a good host and we were happy that we stayed at his place. "
5589,55098,2010-06-20,55452,Ryan,"my wife and i had a great stay at ami's place in dc.  here are a few observations:

the host-  ami is very friendly, accessible, and full of information about the district and his neighborhood in particular.  we visited on the phone prior to arrival and he forwarded a detailed document about his apartment and including some tips on how to arrive, get around, etc.  ami is helpful, but not overbearing or intrusive.  his space becomes your space.

the room-  first, let me address the review just previous to this one.  it notes a bug problem.  this gave me some concern, but on arrival i learned this is not a problem of bugs in the room, but of mosquitos congregating near the entrance of the apartment door.  if you shut the door behind you, you'll not have any problems with them.  and if you have a serious problem with mosquitos, you might reconsider staying in a city built on a swamp.

the apartment is more spacious than i expected.  the bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable.  

the wifi connection is capable, but not blazing (about 1.5-2mbps).  not a problem for me, but keep this in mind if you need more speed.

the neighborhood- in the heart of adams morgan with great shops, bars, and good eats all within a stroll from the apartment.  plenty of mass transportation options nearby.  it's kind of a hike to the dupont metro line, but several bus stops, including the circulator bus, make it easy to get around the district.  take ami's advice and pick up a smart card (available at cvs and other retailers).  even though i'm a seasoned metro rider, i've never been big on the bus system. armed with my smart card and a new app on my iphone, i navigated the buses with equal ease.  

we won't hesitate to check ami's availability the next time we're in dc."
5589,62292,2010-07-08,89329,Jocelyn,"apartment was as described, ami was a helpful host, and the location is great. super easy to walk all over the city. (it is not extremely close to a metro so people who can't walk long distances should be aware of that.) tons of things to do (eat, drink, shop, dance) on 18th st in adams morgan. thank you ami!"
5589,64782,2010-07-15,97312,Christoph,"we had a very good time in amis apartment. the location is excellent: in the heart of a very nice neighbourhood with many shops and restaurants. the apartment is also very quiet! it is perfect for two people, maybe a bit small for four (which wasn't a problem for us since we spent only the nights there). ami was a very good host. even though we didn't meet him personally, the contact on the phone and by mail was warm and helpful. "
5589,70826,2010-07-30,107267,Sarah,"j'ai passé 2 nuits chez ami avec ma mère et tout était parfait. ami est très accueillant, il nous a donné tous les renseignements nécessaires pour le transport, pour se repérer dans la ville... l'appartement est très bien, très pratique, très propre, et est situé dans un quartier animé le soir, pour sortir c'est idéal, cependant l'appartement est très calme. il est situé à 10-15 min du métro qui amène à tous les sites touristiques (mall, maison blanche...) il faut un peu marcher mais honnêtement ce n'est pas gênant.
"
5589,91146,2010-09-06,189775,Bram,"i was attending a conference in washington and ami's place was located a convenient 10 min walk from the venue, the omni shoreham, rock creek. furthermore ami's appartment is clean, well-kept and comes with a generous host! a washing machine and wireless internet are also available for use. in the weekends, the relatively quiet street can become a bit noisier, as it is close to the bars at 18th street, but it wasn't that much of a problem to me.  "
5589,106999,2010-09-28,151196,Tarns N Dave,what a gem. ami is a gracious host providing loads of local information and assistance with getting around. the apartment was perfect for our family of three with everything you needed. location was brilliant allowing us to eat a different international cuisine every night. the bugs mentioned in a previous review were no issue! we would reccomend this to anyone looking for accommodation in dc. thanks ami for a great airbnb experience.
5589,115390,2010-10-10,231858,David,the host was very helpful and fun to talk to.  very convenient location.  no problems with the wi-fi. a bit dark as it is a basement apartment.  no mosquitoes.  a good experience. 
5589,132116,2010-11-02,181489,David,"very nice 1 br apartment in central area close to many restaurants, about a 45 minute walk to the white house, etc.  ami is a wonderful host, very thoughtful. "
5589,150826,2010-12-08,92161,Shari,"ami was a wonderful host and made us feel very welcome.
the apartment is in a great location and neighborhood.
we hope to return sometime soon.

5589,157048,2010-12-22,224366,Jenna,"we thought ami was a lovely kind person who made us feel very at home - and we very much appreciated the terrific coffee he left for us to use. both beds were very comfortable and a great location. the heater was a little noisy but we did so much in washington that we were too tired for the noise to keep us awake. we had no trouble with bugs, just a little with the stiff door which ami kindly oiled for us. very clean, great clear instructions. thanks for a terrific couple of days in this very central location. "
5589,172057,2011-01-18,332201,Alexander,"ami was a great host! he gave some great suggestions how to get to his place from new york (recommended megabus company, that is great) and was very courteous. the apt is situated in very friendly neighborhood with plenty of restaurants, small shops and galleries. strongly recommended!"
5589,175295,2011-01-27,248174,Eric,"as others have commented, this is an ideal location for any conferences at the marriott wardman, hilton, omni shoreham, etc. close to most everything in adams morgan.  although ami was out of town, he had a friend really look after us. the only downside of the place is that it definitely is a bachelor pad. clean comfortable, but could use some basic maintenance (fresh coat of paint, etc.) would definitely stay again."
5589,178971,2011-02-07,261677,Tara Mae,"place wasn't bad, and ami was helpful and gave us a lot of maps of the area.

other than that, we didn't have the best of experiences with the host. he showed up on the second day without calling ahead, which was completely inappropriate on all accounts. we weren't there, but we received an e-mail from him later saying that he had stopped by to pick something up. four women were staying there, and several of us were embarrassed because we might have had underwear laying out. 

the place and location weren't bad, but none of us will ever stay there again."
5589,201995,2011-03-18,334307,Gerald,"we spent 6 days in ami’s apartment and thoroughly enjoyed it. location is good-10+ minutes to 3 metro stations, good bus service at the corner, 2 supermarkets within 5 minutes walk. ami is a gracious host and went out of his way to make sure that we had everything we needed. he was out of town for the last part of our stay and left his contact info and his girlfriend’s number, should there be any problems-there weren’t any. the apartment is spacious–not modern but it works well. it was clean and fully equipped. very adequate refrigerator. we cooked dinners and the kitchen has everything that we needed, including a dishwasher. plenty of sheets and towels. the furniture is very comfortable and the lighting is very good for reading. washer/dryer worked fine. ami left necessary supplies-toilet paper, paper towels, detergent etc, and coffee. only things needing attention: front door sticks so you really have to pull it closed, and the outside security gate is rusty and must be pushed hard to lock. there’s no land line so bring a cell phone. wireless works very well. we would be glad to stay again, when we return to dc. we enjoyed getting to meet ami-he's really interesting and is a nice person."
5589,208419,2011-03-25,155365,Tom,ami was very responsive and accommodating. the apartment is in a great location for walking.
5589,235817,2011-04-23,299536,Sophie,"my experience in ami's apartment was quite mixed, so i will try to break it down. i stayed in ami's apartment for about two weeks.

the host: i didn't actually meet ami in person (he was out of the country during my stay) but his email communication was very good. he left a helpful list of instructions and information detailing everything i needed to know, e.g. internet, heater, trash, shopping, etc. when questions came up, ami was great about writing and even calling (from israel!), which i appreciated. his friendly girlfriend let me in to the apartment initially and showed me the less intuitive things. the area: this apartment is in a perfect location to hang out in adams morgan. it is literally around the corner from awesome cafes, bars, restaurants, the idle time bookstore, and great yoga (at stroga)... really lovely. keep in mind that it is quite far away from the metro -- walking to the u street station every morning took about 15 minutes. the apartment: people have said this before, but in this apartment you are paying for the location. upon arrival i re-read the ad and the comments because i thought i had missed something, but hardly anyone mentioned that the space is dark, even for an english basement. there are four windows, but two of them are covered by plants in the garden. if you plan to spend most of the days outside then this should be fine... but it is depressing to do work there or any other activity that benefits from natural light. there were also electrical issues during my stay that ami handled well from afar, but were still scary. finally, the door to the apartment is difficult to close and the rusty gate requires quite a lot of wrangling every time. not a big deal, but it can be frustrating if you are in a hurry to leave / get in, or if it bothers you to begin the day with rust all over your hands. bottom line: i would stay here again, but only if i were planning to be out all day and in adams morgan at night.

 "
5589,271563,2011-05-20,68002,Alan,"ami was very friendly, sweet and helpful.  his house rules were clear and easy to accommodate.
we did not spend much time in the apartment but everything was adequate for our needs.
the one thing not the best was the comfort of the couch bed.  while it was queen sized it was not very comfortable.
the air mattress and double bed in the bedroom were fine.
"
5589,292790,2011-06-01,491884,Liz,"ami went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  the place was sparkling clean and welcoming, and he even left out coffee for us.  he left us maps of how to get around dc and directions to get to the grocery store.  ami is a great host and i would recommend his place to friends.  "
5589,312541,2011-06-13,655904,Angie,ami was very accommodating.  his apartment was very clean and in a perfect location.  i would definitely stay there again!
5589,342806,2011-06-29,353141,Richie & Gill,"we had a good stay with ami, the correspondence both before and during our stay was excellent. ami gave us lots of information, lent us travel books and train cards and was very informative. he also contacted us during our stay to make sure everything was okay. we had all the facilities we needed, laundry, wifi, tv (no cable), good shower. the apartment is quite a walk from the 3 metro stations around (about 20 to 25 minutes). and as mentioned before is a little dark, but being a basement apartment we had no problems with that and found it ok. there is a great supermarket very close and lots of restaurants, bars etc just around the corner - so location is great - 10 out of 10! if you want to in the thick of things. yes the door locks are a bit stiff but we had no real problem with that and we felt safe and secure. we would stay there again if passing through dc as we had a good value stay.  "
5589,355410,2011-07-05,295220,Daniel,"wow! ami is amazing, he was so helpful to us as soon as we arrived, not to mention the countless amount of effort he went to, to make sure we arrived safely beforehand by called and emailing! we arrived as he was about to leave for the weekend on a camping trip, and made sure he gave enough time to show us around and recommend plenty of places to go in adams morgan and the d.c area, truly a genuinely nice and helpful person.

the house is awesome, it is a basement apartment but has everything, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom etc. nice and spacious, not to mention clean! being a basement apartment it keeps the cool in as it gets very hot and humid in d.c the apartment also had the bonus of air conditioning! 

it is located right next to the main street of adams morgan, which is pretty happening in itself, its about a 40 min walk to the mall and downtown, but the metro is only about a 10 min walk which is great! 

overall we had a fantastic stay and would recommend both ami as a host and the apartment itself, would definitely stay there again!"
5589,390429,2011-07-23,655293,Gunnvör,"we had a great stay in adams morgan and some great days around the city.
adams morgan and the apartment is very well situated for sightseeing around washington whether you want to walk or go by bus or the metro.
the apartment is sufficient in space for 2 adults and there is a great supermarket very closy to the apartment and so is the parking garage if you want to leave your car while you stay in adams morgan - and the price is right!
ami greener was a good and welcoming host.
best, steen and gunnvoer"
5589,431167,2011-08-09,499674,Juri,"we had a pleasant experience staying here. ami accomodated us for four nights!  
he was extremely helpful during the entire rental process. the apartment itself was quaint and charming.
the bed was comfortable and it was nice to have a kitchen so we didn't have to eat out every meal.
we enjoyed our stayin washington d.c. immensely. 
"
5589,466033,2011-08-22,844819,Amit,"i was at ami's appartment with my wife and 2 daughters.
we didn't have the chance to meet him but he was in touch with us by e-mail and (hidden by airbnb) .
ami was really great. he  did everything before during and after our stay to help us. 
the appartment was more than we expected. and was very comfortable.
another dvantage is the location !! 
לישראלים שבינכם - ממליץ בחום על הדירה של עמי. מיקום מעולה !! מרווח ומאובזר"
5589,554845,2011-09-21,1018086,Pao,"ami was a great host. he showed us everything very clearly and gave us indications for bars, restaurants, attractions, subway and stuff.
we have all the apartment: tv, wifi, kitchen, even a washing machine.
subway is 15 minutes away. a lot of good bars and restaurants are one minute walk."
5589,591803,2011-10-03,854679,David,"ami's place is clean, comfortable and well-located.  it's much more spacious than the ""cozy"" description and the photograph lets on, with a living room, full kitchen, bath, bedroom and dressing room.  we slept very well on the bed. ami also has an easy to use washer and dryer in his apt.

ami was waiting for us when we arrived, showed us around the apt., explained how to connect to wifi, where to get buses and shop, etc. he has dc maps and brochures for the use of his guests. there's shopping around the corner on kalorama (sign up for their free discount card!)  and on columbia. lots of restaurants in adams morgan ranging from pricey to amazingly reasonable (like amsterdam falafel). 

there are excellent transportation connections to all parts of the city. from ami's place it's easy to connect to the red line metro at woodley park. the l2 bus leaves every 20-30 min. from the 18th st and belmont bus stop which is a 3 minute walk toward woodley park in one direction, and toward macpherson circle on the other side of the street.  at 18th and columbia, a 5-7 min. walk, there are also dc circulator  buses to woodley park metro and points north, as well as southbound,  that leave every 10 minutes late into the night.

when we arrived we took the yellow line  directly from reagan airport to u-street  and walked to ami's place with our rollaboard bags. it was a longer and more strenuous walk than we had anticipated, so on the way back we took a cab back to the yellow line metro. it was well worth the $8 plus tip for ourselves and our luggage, especially since it was raining.  (if you take the red line to/from the airport you will have to change trains.)

all in all ami's a great place to stay and he is a wonderful host. the only caveat about ami's apt. would be for someone who is physically challenged or has difficulty climbing stairs, as there are a few steep brick steps going down to and up from ami's apt. but we didn't have a problem.

 we had a great time and would happily stay at ami's again on a future visit to dc.

5589,699097,2011-11-07,1268633,Jenny,"the apartment was in a very vibrant neighborhood, with many little shops and great ethnic cuisine. it was a good size, with a comfortable couch. the bedroom had an extra dressing room, which was nice for spreading out the luggage and unpacking without crowding living space. ami gave us full use of his kitchen and cooking tools, which was nice as there are grocery stores nearby and we were able to prepare many of our own meals."
5589,727568,2011-11-18,1151337,Valentina,"my colleges and i enjoyed our stay in washington a lot! many thanks to ami! it was very comfortable in the flat, we could find there everything we need for every day life. the location is perfect: metro is very close, bars and restaurants as well. ami explained very well all the directions, that even during the first evening it was very easy to orientate. you'll definitely like staying at this area and with sucha a great host!"
5589,806157,2011-12-26,1327280,Cecile,"this was a very good stay for us.  it is very convenient to everywhere in the city and for us, was just a few blocks away from where our daughter lives so it was perfect.  
the apartment itself is nice and has all the amenities one needs, actually even more than we needed.  ami is very committed to energy conservation as we are so we did not mind his asking that the thermometer be turned down  or the heater turned off when we left the apartment for the day.  however, because we were away so much it did mean the furniture and walls etc took a while to warm up when we returned.  nonetheless, we were very cozy.
ami was very friendly, cordial and anxious to help us with any information we might need. our only reason for not checking 5 stars on the rating is that he came by the apartment when we were not there.  we would have prefered he not do that but if he needed to, as he did to pick up slippers and to drop off keys with the neighbors , we would have liked a notice of it as landlords are required to do generally.

apart from that, it was perfect."
5589,885432,2012-01-27,1394527,Andreas,"ami was super friendly, and nice to talk to. the apartment is perfectly located and easily accessible with public transit. it is also very spacious and quite. i enjoyed my stay there and can fully recommend the apartment.  "

"
5589,1403864,2012-06-03,1857853,Jeffrey,"we had a fine week staying at ami’s apartment. it was quiet despite being around the corner from a very busy part of the neighborhood.  the neighborhood was  fun to walk around, and we enjoyed the people we met. ami’s apartment was an easy walk from just about anything we needed. stores are close, bus stops are close, even the metro is relatively close. dupont circle is a pleasant stroll away, as is meridian hill park. there are several options nearby for picking up capital bikeshare bicycles, including one near the zoo that’s convenient to the rock creek trail for an easy ride down to the lincoln memorial. ami’s apartment was comfortable on the hottest days without having to run the a/c much at all. gabby got us going, ami checked in with us, and we felt comfortable and safe. we would stay again (assuming ami will have us)."
5589,1567973,2012-06-26,2394431,Chris,"i stayed at ami's apartment in dc for 3 nights. upon arrival, myself and my two friends were greeted by ami and he showed us the apartment, gave us a wealth of helpful tips about the area and dc at large, and furthermore took us for a tour of the neighborhood. he was extremely pleasant and easily contactable at any time. the place itself was extremely clean, very spacious, and in an amazing location in the heart of adams morgan. the neighborhood had an abundance of places to eat and drink, and a great social atmosphere. it was very easy to get to the mall strip from ami's place and see all the sights. if i ever come back to dc again i will definitely try to stay at his place, it was a fantastic experience!"
5589,1836989,2012-07-30,2470583,Andreas,ami was very helpful. the apartment is so close to the lovely adams morgan 18th street that we ended up going out for more meals than we expected and it is also very cool even on hot days. i would definitely check with ami next time we're in dc.

7103,35052,2010-04-11,104666,Michelle,"ran across airbnb purely by accident late one night.  what good fortune to book our week at charlotte's home!  she is by far the most hospitable and accomodating hostess i've met in many years of world travel. though we arrived late, she graciously welcomed us to her home, and patiently offered valuable advice about visiting the local sites. her location is excellent for day-touring with safe parking on the street. dining al fresco in the backyard was an unexpected perk. there's also a lovely forested trail behind the house. how refreshing to find a perfect place to stay in a major city at a reasonable price! our many thanks, we can't wait to return to see more.  michelle, i & j"

7103,37654,2010-04-24,105408,Scott,"when my initial plans to visit dc with my two children fell through i was extremely unhappy. a web search found airbnb, which led to charlotte. i am now extremely pleased that my initial plans failed so my children and i could meet, and stay with, such excellent companions. 
here are some area amenities in no particular order;
the capital crescent trail and the c&o canal towpath are an excellent biking experiences. bike to down georgetown and go to georgetown cupcakes, i'm still aglow from that bit of sin (but not on the weekend, there's a line around the block).
near by is listrani's italian restaurant, well priced with very, very good food.
and, of course, all the rest of the stuff in dc.
so, again, thank you charlotte and co.

7103,133700,2010-11-05,92780,Chris,"our experience with charlotte was top-notch in every way.  the location was great and we enjoyed the little sushi restaurant practically across the street (i think it's kotobuki).  the neighborhood is very appealing. i especially love the cvs that used to be a theater and still has movie posters in the entrance hall.  we rode the d5/d6 bus each way to the mall for $1.50 with our smartcards.

the beds were very comfortable, including air mattresses that charlotte had set up for us (even though we'd brought our own).  the wi-fi was easy to access and perfect, as were all the printed resources available to us to help us with exploring dc.  charlotte took the time to make sure we had what we needed.  she even offered her stove for boiling water since i was clueless on how to use the coffee maker she supplies.  the back yard area was so inviting and relaxing;  i only wish i'd left more time to enjoy it.

it was a wonderful experience, and i truly hope to visit dc again and stay with charlotte.  this is a tremendous alternative to hotels.  "

she also let us use her kitchen which was really nice.
we would highly recommend you to staty here if you are in washington dc."
7103,164496,2011-01-03,194030,Maria,"we spend few days for new year. everything went fantastic from the very beginning. charlotte promptly answered the inquiring e-mail, which is greatly appreciated. communications through e-mail or text where quick and accurate. 
the room (and bathroom) was cozy, intimate and super clean, making it ideal for an enjoyable visit and a good relax. 
in the room we had several maps and info about the city, plenty of tour guide for all kind (typical tourist, not for tourist, with kids, hikes, etc..). the bus worked perfectly for us, making a trip to downtwon (mall), georgetown or dupont circle fast, easy, and relieving from the stress of driving in the city and finding parking. another great thing: the neighborhood  was quiet and safe, we didn't have to worry about finding parking, just parked on the street. charlotte was also very knowledgeable about the area and provided advice on dinning. what a great experience!
absolutely a super host! we'd love to be back."
7103,167201,2011-01-07,142427,Ross,"the best of washington is perfect for those who are looking to visit dc but not be in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the center of town.
the accommodation is very quiet and well presented.
charlotte provided plenty of information about the local area and sights and attractions in dc.  there was metro cards available for use - you just add credit to the card to cover your use.  discounts are available at local grocery stores by using the information provided by charlotte.  if you are looking to use public transport - it is not great.  the bus stop is very nearby but not as convenient or regular as the metro system in dc."
7103,226090,2011-04-14,367101,Heather,charlotte is fantastic - thank you for a wonderful stay in your lovely home!
7103,232089,2011-04-19,476515,Mary K,"we were very comfortable at charlotte's place in dc, the space was cute, comfortable and clean.  the neighborhood was peaceful and felt safe.  we would stay at charlotte's again in a heartbeat."

7103,307555,2011-06-11,334269,Linda,"we had a wonderful stay.  we almost felt as if we were natives of d.c.  after a few attempts driving through town in a rented minivan, we happily rode the bus into the center of the city.  interesting ride through a variety of neighborhoods. 
charlotte is a great host.  she provides terrific information and suggestions.  our night of new orleans jazz at the french embassy is case in point.
the room itself was relaxing and quiet -- a nice counterpoint to city life.
we thank you charlotte!"
7103,316235,2011-06-15,606060,Jacob,"my friend sam and myself stayed in the best of washington for four nights and could not have enjoyed our experience more.  charlotte is thorough in making sure that your stay goes smoothly and comfortably.  you could not find someone more knowledgeable about the area or more willing to help you find fun activities to do in the city. the room is very comfortable and cool with the a/c. it is also very clean. the bus that you have to ride to get into the city (d6 bus) does not come very often, so don't plan on making multiple trips into the city in one day.  overall, a wonderful experience and charlotte is the lady to stay with in d.c."

7103,359752,2011-07-08,276056,Anita,"i am absolutely delighted with our stay and experience in dc.  this is due largely to the wonderful host we found through airnb.  i am highly recommending a stay at the best of washington, dc, because i believe it is the best. our host was kind, caring, and helpful. and the location was awesome too. the people in the area wer also quite friendly and thoughtful of our needs.  loved it!  i can't say enough about how wonderful it was.  thank you charlotte, and airnb!"
7103,425270,2011-08-07,478844,Fábio,"i and carolina had a amanzing experience recently in dc where we spent exactly 1 month there to study. and ""the best of dc"" and charlotte were a great part to make this period have been so nice. the room is very charming, comfortablfe and clean. the view of the green backyard from the room's windows is very nice.

the neighborhood is beautiful, quiet and calm. there are some cafes and restaurants around and a supermarket (safeway) just two blocks from the house. it is also very easy to take a bus to go to other neighborhoods. the bus stop is just one block from the house and the bus will take you to the heart of georgetown for about 10 minutes for instance.

charlotte is very friendly and she gave us some usefull information about the city apart from some maps, city guides, metrocards and other materials that were available in the house.

we hardly recommend the stay in the best of dc.
  "
7103,454876,2011-08-18,519195,Alesa + Shawn,"charlotte's place is just as described in her listing. it's in a safe, scenic, established neighborhood that's convenient for sight-seeing, *excellent* dining or just hanging out. you can get to a supermarket, drugstore and wine market (and even a library!) just around the corner if you need anything on the fly.

the guest area is very roomy, well-appointed, quiet, spotlessly clean and comfortable. she even has stacks of maps, brochures for attractions and guidebooks to the city and region, plus she's always available to recommend a restaurant, a good route for sightseeing - anything you would ask a concierge at a fine hotel. we are extremely lucky to have found charlotte and could not have asked for a more friendly, knowledgeable, gracious host. we highly recommend the best of washington, dc and hope to return there soon ourselves!!

7103,1157927,2012-04-21,1698378,Paula,april was a beautiful month to visit d.c.  half of the room is made up of windows so the beauty of the azaleas was amazing.  the hostess has maps and travel guides available in the room.  there is a local bus that takes you through a lovely section of georgetown to get to downtown d.c.   the neighborhood is quiet and we found ourselves slowing down and enjoying our vacation time.
7103,1194915,2012-04-29,962943,Shaun,exceeded expectations as a host and made for a perfect stay in dc.  i will definitely be contacting charlotte the next time visiting.

charlotte is a delightful person and did everything she could to make our stay enjoyable and could give us some good tips about local restaurants and places to visit.  we can highly recommend this b&b."

(being from the west coast i'd never seen this particular type of cricket before and i was terrified). the neighborhood made me feel incredibly safe. there's a tasty pizza joint nearby and conveniently a cvs and safeway. the abode is itself was very cozy. very clean with a great air conditioning system. charlotte provided a microwave, small refrigerator, coffee maker, plates and silverware. she also stocked the pantry with soda and coffee. when i told charlotte i needed more hangars she generously provided me with them. the view into the backyard is fantastic. i saw birds and squirrels scampering around. my one and only complaint is that there were tiny little black insects that appeared around july. overall my stay was excellent with charlotte making every effort to make my stay more comfortable."

ami provided me with information that benefited me as a tourist, and as a local. he kept up to date with what events were happening in the city, and made some recommendations. his place is in a pretty lively area, and is accessible by two different subway stations. it's too bad that i was only there for a day, because i would've liked to check out the neighborhood as well.

ami made sure he knew about my checking out, and offered coffee and cereal for me in the morning. i ended up sleeping in and missed my bus, and because he knew about my departure time, he woke me up instead of just going on with his day.

overall, i enjoyed my short stay and would stay with ami again. the place was exactly like the pictures showed, and the couch was comfy. i did not need to pull it out at all."

9097,2337841,2012-09-18,2289872,Dina,"ami was a great host: very caring, considerate and eager to help and provide guidance about the city. the place is nice and cosy and the location is amazing. definitely would recommend a stay to anyone looking for a nice location with a great and interesting person as a host."
9641,30948,2010-03-22,79969,Shern,melissa is an excellent hostess. her condo is lovely with sophisticated and voguish furniture. her place is close to public transportation as well as many restaurants and coffee shops. there is also parking available near her condo.

9641,61270,2010-07-05,143951,Cheryl,"if you want to ""see it like a native"" in dc, this is the place to be.  living in a loft on a quiet residential street just steps to the hippest areas in the city: the new 14th street shops and dupont circle. m's place is big and well-equipped, with lots of light and a fabulous deck to have brunch with sunday's the new york times. the air conditioning was divine during july 4th's heat wave. and the neighbors are nice (especially if you have an emergency like we did with the washing machine).  we enjoyed coming back to our old neighborhood and learning about all the new restaurants, pubs, and shops that melissa noted in her organized, detailed manual. and the cats were purrrfectly polite. "
9641,65042,2010-07-15,162458,Bejoy,the place was really lovely... very homely feeling and very well maintained house. 
9641,113837,2010-10-07,240898,Brad,"melissa was a wonderful hostess, and even invited me to join a dinner party she had planned for the night i arrived (which i very much enjoyed).  her place is very clean, quiet, and comfortable, and melissa made me feel very welcome and at home."

9641,142095,2010-11-21,245506,Sophia,"melissa is a great host! coming from europe and having never been to dc before, melissa made me feel home from the first day until the end of my four-week stay at the apartment we shared together (and her two shy, but friendly cats). besides providing an excellent manual with practical information about the loft, transportation and neighborhood, melissa was very responsive to all my questions and invited me to take part in some of her everyday life. after long workdays, i enjoyed having a cup of tea or a home-made dinner in front of the cozy open fire, or going out to some of the hippest places in town. the apartment itself is big, very clean, sunny, comfortable and tastefully furnished. it is conveniently located on a quiet residential street in the heart of the capital within walking distance to many restaurants, bars, cafés, shops and food markets as well as to major sightseeing places. in sum, melissa’s place is definitely the place to be! i highly recommend it to anybody staying for a short or – as in my case – a long term in dc, especially if you want to have the real experience of living like a native in dc’s best neighborhood. thank you melissa, it was a pleasure to stay with you and i hope one day to return. sophia, switzerland"
9641,196600,2011-03-11,378509,Camilla,"melissa was a very gracious and accommodating hostess. the apartment was lovely, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. there were even 2 cats in the apartment. the neighborhood around the apartment is great- there are wonderful choices for food within walking distance, and melissa did a good job in providing a list of recommended places to check out."
9641,265470,2011-05-16,478215,Kristin,"perfect location very close to great restaurants and wine bars. also, convenient to catch a cab. quick ride to/from the airport. there is a zipcar location close by also. the loft is comfortable and beautifully decorated. melissa was a great hostess and very knowledgeable of the area...especially the foodie scene. highly recommend staying there. we plan to visit again soon."

9641,1818690,2012-07-28,2428989,Abbey,"perfect location, lovely and comfortable flat, and responsive host. i would recommend this to anyone travelling through dc. better for cat lovers, however, as there was quite a lot of work required to accommodate the two feline friends. other guests may be able to arrange that the host takes the cats away, which would be a plus."
9641,2736291,2012-10-28,3426045,Pamela,"i highly recommend a stay at melissa's swanky logan circle loft. the space is comfortable and had everything i required for a comfortable stay. the location is great with restaurants, whole foods, a yoga studio and more within a block or two. government business, museums, and other destinations are all within easy reach of public transportation or cab service. melissa was very easy to work with and a great hostess. leopold and madison--the loft's furry amenities--were fantastic companions and made me feel right at home. "
9641,3117786,2012-12-19,186613,Linda,"despite arriving at a late time melissa was there waiting in her beautiful apartment to show me round and to introduce me to my new 4 legged friends that she had left in my care.
the apartment is very comfortable and beautifully decorated; like a home away from home; somewhere to relax at the end of the day.  warm and cosy too with all the mod-cons that are needed that you can never find in a hotel!
the location was great.  whole foods, bars, starbucks, restaurants within 5 minutes walk plus the bike share which we used to get around dc.  it was also an easy walk to all of the national landmarks.
hanks on the corner of 17th and q was great for our final dinner - a great recommendation from melissa.  more a local restaurant versus one just for tourists.
melissa - thank you so much for everything.  it was our pleasure to be able to enjoy your apartment.
happy holidays!

9641,3561637,2013-02-17,3020847,David,"the flat is lovely, and in the perfect location. melissa was very responsive. there was a small problem with the cleaning people, but melissa went out of her way to fix things. "

"
9641,6139052,2013-07-31,7572123,Joe,melissa is a flexible and accommodating host.  she took a risk on a last-minute family of 5 and we really appreciated her willingness to help us out.  she had some great tips for the city and bent over backwards helping us solve the great dc parking conundrum.  i feel like we've made a new friend in dc that we look forward keeping up with.  i can highly recommend staying with melissa!
9641,6771484,2013-08-24,7634124,Julia,"as the other reviews state, the location is unbeatable, and the loft is spacious. it was a treat to stay here! for guests who can't maneuver as easily, note that the stairs into the bedroom loft are rather steep and the step into the tub/shower might be tricky. all lovely overall!"
9641,9214481,2013-12-14,6974036,Elizabeth,the loft is very comfortable and conveniently located. all you need is close by!
11785,23911,2010-01-12,60922,Chanae,"we just stayed in teresa's basement (sanctuary near cathedral) and i couldn't have found a nicer place. the kitchen is my favorite feature since i have food allergies and prefer to cook, it was well stocked with all the appliances and utensils you could need. teresa was very knowledgeable of the area, super warm and friendly. the neighborhood was very safe and is walking distance to many restaraunts, bars, grocery stores and a really cool kids playground. i would definitley recommend to everyone i know and a bargain price compared to similarly equipped hotels in the area."
11785,25141,2010-01-31,52327,Greg,"the accommodations in teresa's basement apartment were clean and overall superb. teresa was extremely friendly and helpful to my 4 friends in visiting for the weekend.  they were very very impressed with the hospitality, warm fire and conversation!  "

11785,31820,2010-03-28,67290,Clay,"it was a pleasure staying in teresa's ""sanctuary near cathedral."". she and her family were very accomodating from the moment that we arrived.  the apartment was clean, well,
equipped, and very comfortable. i stayed on the pull out sofa bed, which was as comfortable as one could expect it to be, while my friend stayed in the sizeable bedroom. the apartment is two blocks away from the metro bus which you can either take all the way downtown or take to one of the metro subway stops. the subway is clean, safe, and much easier to use than new york's. you can get downtown in about 30 mins via metro, about 12 in your own car. all in all a great stay, i highly recommend ""sanctuary near cathedral."""
11785,32778,2010-04-02,83702,Eric,"wonderful and accomodating hosts. room was clean, spacious, and comfortable, even for a family of 4. distance to metro is inconvenient, but bus stops are close. within walking distance to the national cathedral (beautiful day and night). includes a wonderful full kitchen for preparing your own meals."
11785,34322,2010-04-09,70524,Laura,"what a wonderful host! she has a great set up in in the basement with a private entrance, very comfortable bedding and a fully stocked kitchen.  her knowledge of the area is fantastic with many helpful hints and suggestions.  we had 3 children and she went out of her way to make sure all our needs were met and more.  we highly recommend her!!

11785,34768,2010-04-11,81458,Michael,"the place was huge!  also very clean and quiet, and teresa was very helpful and accommodating."
11785,36030,2010-04-17,78357,Philip,"we (2 adults, 3 kids) stayed in teresa's basement suite - ""sanctuary near cathedral"".  teresa and reid were very friendly and helpful, and teresa provided full orientation and 'getting-around' tips when we arrived.  the recently-renovated apartment provides ample space for a family, with a well-equipped kitchen for self-catering, and a separate entrance for coming and going. the neighbourhood is leafy and safe - just north of the georgetown area.  the house is some distance from the subway, but nearby buses provide easy access to the downtown area.  the only downside to the apartment is that it incorporates shared laundry facilities, so other tenants need access to the basement during the day, but there is a night time curfew on access, so this was not too big a deal.
i would highly recommend teresa's place."
11785,37504,2010-04-24,72133,Randy,we (2 adults and 1 child) enjoyed sanctuary near cathedral for a week and completely agree with philip k review. we would recommend the place and hope to come back in future.
11785,45142,2010-05-23,48877,Peggy,"teresa's place is everything it claims to be and more.  we stayed in the basement apartment which was perfect for a family gathering.  both the bed and the sofa bed were very comfortable.  the large, well equipped kitchen was wonderful. there were plenty of towels, pillows, covers, etc. both teresa and reid were very friendly and knowledgeable hosts.  they were very accommodating but not overbearing.  the neighborhood was quiet, lovely, and safe. we felt totally comfortable and look forward to a return visit."
11785,46470,2010-05-26,93327,Pam,"we truely enjoyed staying at teresa's and reids great apartment. our family was very comfortable in it. plenty of space for four.

thank you, pam and sal gomez"
11785,52032,2010-06-12,95070,Catherine,"this is a delightful place to stay and the hospitality of teresa and reed is beyond compare.  the apartment is all we expected and more and the location is close to busses and a short ride from the metro. a beautiful and quiet neighborhood but the very best part has to be the hospitality and genuine goodwill of the hosts.  when i became ill, teresa went the extra mile and took me to the hospital and checked on me the rest of that day.  this is a marvelous place to stay in dc!"
11785,54322,2010-06-18,110323,David,"beautiful part of dc. perfect location for visiting our nation's capitol. teresa and reid were nothing short of grasious. the apartment fit our family of 5 well, 2 adults and 3 teenagers. we would, absolutely, recommend santcuary near cathedral."

11785,67582,2010-07-22,158058,Gottfried,we were very warmly received and had a great time in washington. the apartment has everything inside and theresa also arranged for the first day some breakfast. teresa and reid are very helpful to give guidance regarding sight seeing spots in washington. we had also a great evening with them and some neighbours on the deck. we can highly reccomend this apartment.
11785,70072,2010-07-28,136059,Gail,"our family of four stayed in teresa and reid's apartment during a visit to the nation's capital.  teresa amd reid were both extremely kind, helpful and hospitible.  teresa oriented us to the neighborhood and helped us with transportation options.  the apartment was beautiful, comfortable and very clean.  we highly recommend the sanctuary near the cathedral."
11785,71200,2010-07-30,178264,Amir,"the good: 

great location, pics don't do the apartment justice! teresa was always a phone call away. she took the time to give us a quick rundown to the area which really helped. the walk in closet alone was massive, it could have easily been another bedroom! nice touches, tile in the shower, granite counter tops, breakfast included. 

the bad: 

nothing really, i'm 6'5"" and i was able to get around in the apartment just fine though those who are taller may need to duck a bit. wish there had been a dvd player but the cable was great. 

we'll be back! "
11785,84830,2010-08-26,104386,Anne,"we absolutely love our stay in the basement apartment of the ''sanctuary''. the place is absolutely spotless and very well equipped. it very confortably accomodates a family of four and the breakfast provided was very much appreciated after a late arrival in dc.

teresa was and extraordinary host and was very helpful in helping us find our way through the (not tourist-friendly) dc transit system.

thanks for everything, teresa and reid! "
11785,85748,2010-08-27,194981,Ravit Hila,"wow!!! we had such a great time at washington dc.
the location is great! teresa and her husband are so nice,helpful, kind and clean!
the kids really loved them. 
the place was clean,  comfortable and the kids didn't want to leave the apartment the first  night!!!! they just wanted to stay there
thank you so much for everything!!!!!!
if we get back there- we will defen contact you and if anyone  else considering the place- do not think twice!
thanks for the popcorn, cereal, milk and just everything!!!!

11785,109386,2010-10-01,45182,Tom,"teresa is the perfect host--pleasant, erudite and helpful.  the basement apartment is clean and well-appointed.  at 6'1"", i fit nicely.  had i been any taller, however, i might have banged the bathroom ceiling.

facetiousness aside, this is a beautiful apartment in a great location with a wonderful host.  one could do no better."
11785,111773,2010-10-04,248004,Angela,"my husband, three year old daughter and i stayed in teresa's apartment while we were in dc for his foreign service exam. all i can say is that it was great!

it's close to everything, both places to walk to close, and within driving distance. the national cathedral is only a few blocks away, and there are normal parks within walking distance, too.

it was so nice to be able to come home at night to a ""home"" rather than an apartment where everything is just crammed in. having the kitchen (with so many supplies already available) meant that we could buy groceries and eat at home, too.

my daughter is still asking when we are going to go back to our ""sometimes house in dc."" hopefully soon!"
11785,114143,2010-10-08,224080,Bety,"mi esposo, mis tres hijas y yo pasamos un maravilloso tiempo en washington, en el departamento de teresa, muy acogedor y todo el equipo de muy buena calidad, nos sentimos realmente en casa. teresa y reid son muy amables y realmente sentimos mucho irnos porque habíamos reservado en nueva york, y definitivamente nos hubiera gustado pasar mas tiempo con teresa. lo recomiendo mucho y regresaríamos felices. la ubicación es excelente."
11785,118244,2010-10-13,214105,Sue,"we stayed at teresa's flat in october.  what a delight!  the flat is in a perfect location, clean, comfortable,  and welcoming.  we look forward to staying here again and will recommend it to our many friends who travel and stay in the dc area."
11785,119464,2010-10-15,3184358,Emilie,"the apartment was amazing.... all was in there to enjoy the stay; new and well decorated, this place is situated in a beautiful  neighborhood. perfect for 4 people. five  min by walk to the nice french restaurant ""cafe de luxe"" and the cathedral. teresa and her husband was very nice and welcoming. our future stop in washington would surely go through this place. "
11785,123631,2010-10-21,184074,Dave,"two friends on a dc tourist holiday stayed here in october. 

it is a squeaky-clean, comfortable, fully-equipped, well maintained and spacious apartment in a beautiful neighborhood. it is easily accessible by several bus lines and not too far from the metro. its proximity to the national cathedral offers people a beautiful destination just a few blocks away -- and on certain evenings it was a treat to hear, during a stroll, the ""bell practice"" emanating softly from the grounds. 

our hosts, teresa and reid, were very accommodating and it was a pleasure to meet them.

the apartment is quite private until someone wants to do their laundry in the shared laundry room. it's wonderful to have laundry facilities available, though it may not be the best choice for a romantic getaway!

but for us it was perfect and we look forward to returning. and, we recommend it highly!

11785,127490,2010-10-26,215765,Teresa,"we had a wonderful time at teresa's apartment - it was a perfect size for our family and gave us the extra space we needed when travelling with young children. my girls both loved teresa (and her peanut butter cookies)and we were all made to feel very welcome.

the neighbourhood is quiet and close to restaurants, supermarkets and the bus is only around the corner. teresa and reid were always there to give us advice when needed.

we will definitely be back next time we're in dc!"
11785,130889,2010-11-01,229600,Karen,"we stayed with teresa late october, 2010.  what a pleasure to be able to relax in a warm, comfortable apartment, away from the big city traffic and noise.  teresa was knowledgeable about the area and had a number of fine, practical recomendations regarding parking and local shops.  although the noise from other guests on saturday night was disturbing, and the occasional interuption from someone else doing laundry was ackward, we would have no touble staying again.  it was a pleasure and we really enjoyed ourselves!  great value, and we hope to be back another time!

11785,151906,2010-12-11,255579,Kathleen,we had a great time.  the apartment was clean and well stocked.  thank you again.
11785,179103,2011-02-07,47111,Megan,staying at teresa's apartment was like staying with family. she was so welcoming and kind and helpful in so many ways from navigating the city to providing directions for finding obscure monuments. her hospitality was amazing. the apartment offers everything you could want and is quite comfortable and the neighborhood is fabulous.
11785,181547,2011-02-13,366745,Sheri,"lovely hideaway on this quiet street,  from the bustle of the city.  all the amenities of home at a convenient location in dc.  hostess very gracious and helpful.  we'll definitely choose this location again in future stays in dc."
11785,182153,2011-02-14,311113,Hammad,this was a marvelous apartment. teresa was a gracious host in allowing me to hold a small gathering in the space and she even helped me cut the roses for the vase. highly recommended.

11785,196097,2011-03-10,365948,Dan,"in our nation's capitol to tell congress to stop bickering, and preserve funding for historic preservation.  preservation means local jobs that can't be sent overseas.  but when you are in dc in these tough times, you need a place that's comfortable and relaxing.  that's what you get in teresa's sanctuary.  comfort and easy access to downtown and georgetown. cabs are quick, busses are just a few blocks away. and the hostess is too nice.  i'll be back."
11785,202189,2011-03-18,389261,Tiffany,"teresa and her husband were fantastic hosts!! the apartment was extremely clean, spacious, and welcoming. the location is amazing and is pretty close to downtown. next time i am in washington d.c we will definitely stay with her again!! "
11785,204199,2011-03-20,440395,Manish,"teresa's 'sanctuary' is wonderful! we stayed for just one night but could simply have not asked for a kinder and more accommodating host. she allowed us to move into her lovely basement for a little extra, and right from the go it was obvious that she and her husband take great care in making their tenant's stay the best possible one. the basement itself was huge, and in immaculate condition; the decked-out kitchen was stocked with your basic breakfast and was equipped to handle a nice dinner or more. the neighborhood itself is beautiful and very peaceful. we thought transportation might be tricky (not many cab drivers knew the address but its actually extremely easy to get there once you know what to say) --- on the other hand, there's two bus stops leading into different parts of the town just 2 blocks away, and that was rather convenient. 

would love to stay there again if she'd have us, i think we were a bit of a bother sleeping in rather late on our checkout date, but teresa was too sweet to show it! thank you so much!"
11785,212055,2011-03-29,377943,Risto,teresa is a wonderful hostess - it was almost like visiting a friend. the apartment is well-equipped and comfortable.
11785,214987,2011-04-02,373127,Julie,"we had a great week at teresa and reid's house!  their insider tips regarding transportation, dining, etc. were invaluable.  the apartment was very neat and clean.  the kids and i enjoyed as  much of dc as we could given our short 5 day stay.  we would definitely recommend teresa's apartment to any other family traveling to the city.  we may return sooner rather than later :)"
11785,216889,2011-04-04,424671,Linnette,"wonderful apartment. fit 6 of us comfortably. clean, warm, and updated. teresa was extremely helpful and kind. great safe location."

we were welcome by teresa and her husband when we arrived.

the flat is outstanding. every thing was absolutely perfect the quality of the towels, the bed linen, breakfast was provided.

it is a little bit far from the city center, however the neighboohood is lovely, you can enjoy walking.

my boys loved the place and even had a chance to play with teresa's son whom they did like very much. 

nice place to stay, would recommend it to anyone.

11785,230530,2011-04-18,479064,Wendy,"this apartment is just as it appears in the pictures.  very convenient to the cathedral, with plenty of on-street parking (when we were there in april).  the hosts were helpful and accommodating.  we didn't use the kitchen much during our stay, but it is well-stocked and, like the rest of the apartment, immaculate."
11785,235915,2011-04-23,366329,Karen,"the apartment was a great place for our family of five. we liked being able to walk to the cathedral and the national zoo. the neighborhood is beautiful! teresa and reed were very helpful and generous. they loaned us their binoculars for our visit to the cathedral and shared their deck with us. the sleeping arrangements were nice including the air mattress for our son. the double bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. the kitchen was well equipped as advertised and included more than we expected (i.e. microwave popcorn, condiments and cereal) our children really enjoyed the fenced in yard and the hammock. our super sensitive noses could smell the cats upon arriving but opening the windows during the day fixed that."
11785,246355,2011-05-01,417205,Shelley,"we had a great time at teresa and reids home!  they are just such welcoming people.  when we arrived reid was there to greet us (and otis too)!  we sat on their patio and visited for a bit which made us really feel at ease.  i had never done an airbnb before and was nervous...but  this was such a great experience.  teresa has everything you could need in the apartment...even a blow dryer!  the linens & towels were nice and everything was clean.  we had hot water for showers and she even had breakfast food available in the refrigerator for us.  teresa and reid were great about helping us with anything they could from directions, bus routes and reid was even nice enough to try and send a fax for us.  i can't say enough good things.  i am hoping my daughter will go to dc within the next year and get the opportunity to stay at teresa and reids.  the house is fabulous and was built in 1927.  patio is beautiful with the lights in the trees in the evenings!  we flew in from ca and our kids drove in from no carolina.  what a really nice visit we had at the sanctuary near the cathedral!  it was almost like suburbia in the city...after long days touring we could go back to the apartment and really relax!  and we slept oh so well...mattress is great!"
11785,252772,2011-05-05,546773,Benton,teresa was a great host. she was easy to contact to set up the arrival and was very accommodating when we got there. the apartment was incredible - including a great kitchen that would be the envy of just about anyone who lives in dc. i would absolutely recommend her and this apartment to anyone visiting washington.
11785,259255,2011-05-11,380016,Carrie,"wonderful combination of hospitality and privacy, not to mention perfect location and facility.  thanks so much for helping make my son's graduation such a special event!"
11785,272240,2011-05-20,68955,Kimberly,"my family of four recently stayed at teresa's sanctuary near the cathedral and had a wonderful time. the basement flat is spacious, very clean, and nicely decorated. the kitchen is fabulous - granite and custom cabinets! the ceiling is a bit low in places, which was no problem for me, but my husband (who is 6'3"") had to duck his head in some spots. everything you could think of for a visit was provided: hair dryer, clothes iron and ironing board, clothes drying rack, laundry basket, maps and travel guides, board games, and a pantry stocked with snacks, coffee, tea, and breakfast cereals (even juice, milk, butter, and condiments!) my 3-year-old son loved the chocolate cheerios. normally shy, my son took right to teresa when she asked him to help her find the candyland game. for the rest of our visit, he repeatedly asked where the ""nice lady upstairs"" was and if we could go visit her and her cats. i think you have a new fan, teresa. "
11785,309224,2011-06-12,456586,LouAnn,the apartment was quite nice.  teresa's place is located in a very nice part of the city.  it's close to the cathedral and a couple of blocks away from the bus lines.  
11785,358151,2011-07-07,430867,William,"teresa's house is comfortable, clean and located in a safe neighborhood that is utterly charming.  the bus line is located close by which allows one to easily access downtown dc."
11785,384723,2011-07-20,369708,John,"teresa's apartment was great. it is located in a very quiet and safe district. it was very comfortable, clean and modern. it is exactly as the photos show. the kitchen is a lovely large area with all the mod-cons. the sofa folds out into a huge double bed. there is a large walk-in closet. the laundry room is great addition and we could easily wash our clothes and dry them very quickly - they are awesome machines! even though we never got a chance to use it, there is a decking area with barbecue facilities outside the house and we were able to park our rental car in the drive way.
in terms of location, it is a very short walk to the cathedral (the second biggest in america!) and a bit of a longer walk (25 minutes) to the nearest metro station and about a 10 minute walk to the nearest grocery store (you can also drive there and park in the free undergound parking lot).
overall - awesome stay. we love dc and would love to visit again and spend longer touring around. teresa and reid were great hosts and very friendly and welcoming and we would recommend their apartment to anyone visiting the dc area."
11785,427538,2011-08-08,516537,Suzanne,"our family of five really enjoying staying in this wonderful basement apartment.  we had our own entrance and lots of room.  teresa and reid were so friendly, informative and helpful.  the beds were very comfortable, the closet more than spacious and the home quite quiet and serene.  we enjoyed cooking in the fabulous kitchen and watching movies on their large flat screen tv.  the kids loved and so did we - we'd love to go back.  it was easy to get around in dc and fairly close to all the sights."
11785,436226,2011-08-11,671353,Jasper,"we had a great time in washington! the basement we stayed in was very well equipped and the location couldn't be any better. we've been very well taken care of by teresa and we'll consider coming back again.
thanks teresa!"
11785,452873,2011-08-17,696353,Xin,"six of us (the whole family) spent a week at teresa's place. teresa and her husband are great hosts.  room is neat & clean (as advertised). her house is very close to multiple bus lines (all within 5-10 minutes of walking distance). 
one small problem (partly is my fault): the sofa bed was not very comfortable. airbed is a lot better and i should ask for one after the first night.
if i ever visit dc again, i will rent her place in a heart beat!
."
11785,473618,2011-08-25,300094,Amy,"simply awesome!!! the space was fantastic with everything we needed.  we immediately felt right at home and the location was perfect. the neighborhood was very nice and easy to get around.  teresa does an awesome job making sure that everything you need is available.  she thought of everything and then some.  we were very impressed with her organization and supplies. we cooked all of our dinners and breakfasts iin the wonderful kitchen and the cable and internet worked great. there is a great whole foods grocery store very close by and the foods are very healthy.  the neighbors, kitty and her daughters were great and very accomodating. they helped us with parking and we can't thank them enough. whenever we plan to visit dc in the future we will definitely be looking forward to staying at teresa's apartment.  thank you again!  rob and amy   "
11785,482028,2011-08-28,966888,Mauricio,excellent place to stay... more that i was expecting!
11785,501844,2011-09-05,94089,Carlos,"my family and i had the pleasure of staying with teresa during labor day weekend. teresa was very helpful and very knowledgeable about dc area. the home is beautiful and well located near georgetown district with many nearby grocery stores, shops and restaurants. i would gladly stay there again "
11785,553887,2011-09-21,862577,Mairead,"teresa and reid are great hosts, beautiful neighbourhood with a clean and spacious apartment. highly recommend! "
11785,567606,2011-09-26,474468,Fiona,"my family and i spent 4 days in teresa's home this september. i cannot praise it highly enough. the apartment was beautiful, spotlessly clean and very convenient to explore the washington area. teresa and her husband were kind, knowledgeable and gracious hosts.

the apartment itself is spacious, modern and well appointed, with all mod-cons. we explored the georgetown area on foot from here easily enough and had no problem using the bus service to get downtown. washington is a remarkably easy city to navigate.

i would have no problem recommending this apartment to anyone and it will encourage me to try airbnb again!"
11785,592399,2011-10-03,859586,Marene,"this place is enormous! it is really very comportable, as it has everything you might need, from wi-fi to a big kitchen. there is not much going on in the neighbourhood, so if you want to be able to step out for a nice breakfast or whatever, this isn't the place to book. it is however very good to relax and wind down (which was just what we needed after 2 weeks of travelling!). 

the neighbourhood is residential and very quiet, with the nearest metro stop a 25 minute walk away. the bus (a stop just around the corner) takes you to the smithsonian in about 20 mins.  the taxi from union station to the house cost us $18,50.

the laundry room (which we did not use) is shared with the upstairs occupants, so we had 3 different people  coming down in one day to take laundry in and out, put it in the dryer, etc. i think that might be something to take into consideration when you are a very private person.

finally - teresa and reid were very friendly and communication with them was very easy."
11785,598305,2011-10-04,1152090,Anna,"we had a contributor stay at teresa's sanctuary by cathedral for a documentary shoot. she was nice enough to let us use her gorgeous main floor living room for the shoot which went incredibly well. 

the location is also in a great area in washington and i would highly recommend staying or working with her again in the future!

anna"
11785,613412,2011-10-10,820271,Kristen,we had the best stay in dc.  what a wonderful apartment and teresa could not have been nicer or more helpful.  she even had breakfast stuff ready for us so we did not have to run around in the morning.   we would definitely stay there again and my son keeps kidding about how the kitchen and bathroom were nicer than our own at home!
11785,624757,2011-10-12,1099493,Matthew,"teresa and reid are great hosts. the sanctuary apartment is a great space that can comfortably accommodate many people. they even cooked me a canadian thanksgiving dinner.

11785,634578,2011-10-16,590519,Rosie,"we stayed withteresa and reid for only one night, but it was a fantastic experience. the apartment is wonderful. the kitchen is particularly good! reid was super friendly and helpful, the location is fantastic and it was great value for money. 

 "
11785,645495,2011-10-19,1213406,Christine,"teresa and reed were very warm and welcoming, which made us feel at home right away.  the apartment was extremely comfortable and beautifully decorated.  the kitchen was a dream; it had everything we could have wanted in it!  we'd definitely like to stay with them again!"
11785,657135,2011-10-24,935989,Lisa,"this was one one of our best air bnb experiences. lovely home, friendly, helpful and experienced host. the rooms were private, spotless, the sheets were lovely and it was exactly as described - the photos are really accurate. a really pleasant quiet stay in a lovely home. the kitchen had lovely appliances, and was meticulously neat and well organized. "
11785,666847,2011-10-26,1025719,Kristin,teresa was very accommodating and responsive to all my inquiries. the rooms we stayed in were very nice - clean and comfortable.
11785,675708,2011-10-30,1238761,Amy,"this is a very nice basement apartment with a full kitchen and access to a washer/dryer.  our hosts, teresa & reid, were very helpful and provided  lots of info on the area and great restaurants. the kitchen was fully stocked with coffee, tea, condiments and there was even milk and yogurt in the fridge :o)

the bus stop was a short walk from the house. the bus ride took about 30 minutes to get to the nat'l mall.  

the only negative is the low ceiling height in the bathroom. the apartment was a bit smaller than expected, but it is a great rental and would highly recommend it.  "
11785,686181,2011-11-02,1114766,Daniel,"great place, really nicely kept, brilliant location, friendliest hosts."
11785,694330,2011-11-05,181630,Peter,"teresa's place is a delight!  pleasant, spacious apartment, all the trimmings, reasonable price, warm hospitality.  i will come again."

paul and jeanette woei.  suriname, s.a."
11785,793026,2011-12-19,1263533,Sarah,"we had a great stay at teresa's place. teresa and reed are excellent hosts and the apartment has everything you need. we loved the kitchen, teresa has thought of everything and they even had a nice starter of cereals, coffee, and other snacks. 

we stayed two weeks with two young kids. the place worked well for us with the little ones because they could share the pull out couch and the main bed is comfortable (super important!)  plenty of light for a basement apartment.  there are some low spots in the ceiling because of ducts, but my husband is 6'5"" and he managed. 

the location is convenient, about a 15 min bus ride downtown. the bus system can be a bit intimidating but once you figure out the two main wisconsin and massachusetts routes you realize that there is a bus headed in either direction every 15 min. 

it is a great way to experience d.c. and feel like more of a resident instead of a transient. a nice bonus if you run or hike trails, the house is close (.25 mile?) to a rock cr. tributary that goes all the way down to the o&c trail on the potomac. awesome run. 

thanks teresa and reed, you guys are great and we loved your home!!"
11785,800376,2011-12-22,1489752,Gazel,"we stayed with teresa and reid in dec 2011 and they were amazing hosts, ensuring we have everything we need from coffee to cereals and always ready to answer any of our questions. the place was very spacious and a short walk away from some eateries and shops. bus ride to the city area was about 20-30mins. will definitely recommend to others!"
11785,802423,2011-12-23,1489752,Gazel,we stayed with teresa and reid in dec 2011 and it was a lovely experience. teresa responded quickly to all my messages and provided extremely useful tips about washington's bus and road system and attractions when we arrived. they provided maps that were lifesavers when we were out walking around dc. lovely lovely hosts. 
11785,843410,2012-01-06,1098199,Janis,"teresa was so warm and welcoming. she had many stories to tell about washington and really helped us planning our sightseeing trip. she even had maps tourist infos in the apartment. 
the apartment was more than great :) very nice furnitured and we didn't miss anything. the kitchen was nice and is a motivation to cook yourself. it had everything we needed. even herbs and spices where there. teresa bought us some milk and cereals for our breakfast.
everything was really clean and we felt so comfortable. this was the best apartment i booked with airbnb so far. thank you teressa. we had a blast! 
"
11785,848569,2012-01-08,444386,Faustino,"we stayed three nights at teresa's house, and it was a very positive experience.

the apartment is just as in the pictures of airbnb, in fact is a basement but a very complete and nice one. it has a bedroom with lots of space for luggage, a full equipped kitchen, plus a living room with cable tv with a sofa bed.

teresa and reid are wonderful hosts, they were waiting us with milk, cereal, orange juice and yogurth, both were always kind and open for every question we had.

the house is set in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood.

i would stay there again."
11785,860380,2012-01-13,1505025,Federico,"teresa and her family were excelent hosts. they make our washignton experience a great one. the place was as expected: super clean, comfortable and fully-equipped. teresa and reid gave us a lot of useful information about the city and helped us with our interests. thank you for being so generous! "
11785,872736,2012-01-20,1281619,Paul,"perfection!
the house was lovely, the hosts perfect, and the basement area we had was huge! lovely kitchen/furniture etc and a separate door so we could go in and out without bothering the rest of the house.
our hosts welcomed us, helped us plan our stay and gave us tips galore. right near an exclennet bus route that took you past the white house on the way to capita hill (couldn't have been more perfect). the metro is a bit of a walk away - but we still did that, even in the rain.
washington is lovely, and staying here was perfect. couldn't recommend it any higher - best place we stayed in our long trip."
11785,891471,2012-01-30,1463539,Frédéric,"the appartment was very clean, well equipped and furnished. teresa was very welcoming and helped us to prepare our week-end. the location is great, we spent there a pleasant moment."
11785,942991,2012-02-23,716725,Pat,"an excellent apartment with wonderful hosts.  teresa and her husband reed have figured it out.  they understand what travelers need, want and hope for, and provide it.  good reading light by the bed?  check.  stacks of tourist information?  check.  kitchen stocked with staples?  check.  helpful pre-trip suggestions (after you've booked!)? check.  new, industrial strength washer and dryer?  check.  all the minimum requirements - good beds, clean space, working bathroom, heat, etc. - are more than fulfilled too.

we were surprised when we saw the space...for once, the pictures don't do it justice.  it's a daylight basement with natural light in pretty much every room.  we almost certainly will be back - a week's not near enough time to do dc - and will definitely use teresa's place.  we'll check availability and book the trip around it!

the distance from the mall isn't a big deal - several bus lines are within a few blocks.  it can take up to 45 minutes from the capital to her place on the bus at rush hour; otherwise its a  a quick 20 minutes.

we loved it!     "
11785,987497,2012-03-11,1638391,Sharold,"we had a great time.   it was a great space.   we are walkers and found much of what we wanted within 20 to 30 minutes walk.   the buses were also very handy.   we also found great food choices in the area.  

i certainly would stay there again.  a very positive experience with air b&b."
11785,1001396,2012-03-15,1184861,Bhavik,"the apartment was very nice, there was enough space for 5 of us to comfortable stay.

11785,1092410,2012-04-07,1628296,Kimberly,my family and i stayed in this wonderful apartment. it is beautifully decorated and had plenty of room.  teresa and her husband were very sweet and accomodating.  were available for us if we had questions.  the metro bus stop was close and easy access to all the sites we wanted to see.   thank you both for such a memorable stay.  will recommend to anyone staying in the dc area.  
11785,1104712,2012-04-10,1982706,Jeanne,"great apartment and great hosts!!  it was very clean, spacious and was fully stocked with the basic essentials that you need - not all apartments do this!  the kitchen was lovely!!  they even got us yogurt and milk!  teresa and reid were very nice and warm and we felt that we were their house guests!  the house has a nice deck where you can sit and enjoy the weather (which was beautiful while we were there).  i would definitely stay here again the next time i am in dc."
11785,1110336,2012-04-12,1612146,Wendy,"sorry for the delay. my family and i really enjoyed the stay at teresa's place. when we arrived, they were still cleaning (we arrived at noon time, they are so nice to let us check in early). and there is plenty of food prepared for us, breakfast, milk, juice, the kitchen is perfect, it provides basically everything we need (even chopsticks). originally, i was concerned about the laundry access, but we find it ok, it didn't disturb us at all. it is close to bus stop, we travelled by bus every day. very close to the catheral, it is a shame that we didn't have time to visit the catheral. the area is so safe and leafy, i would highly recommend teresa's place. washington's best place to stay!"
11785,1163057,2012-04-22,1753503,Jeremy,"teresa was an excellent host. she always responded quickly to my messages and provided useful tips about washington's bus system and attractions prior to my arrival. i did not meet her in person because she was out of town to attend a family event but she arranged for the apartment to be cleaned. communication was clear throughout, which made our check-in and out during her absence absolutely hassle-free. the pictures did the apartment justice. it was as comfortable and well equipped as the pictures show. teresa provided yoghurt, milk and cereal for breakfast, which was a nice touch. the apartment was clean, the kitchen was also fully equipped and the bathroom was nice too. linens and towels were great. we were satisfied with the beds and mattresses provided for six people, although space was a little tight and perhaps more comfortable for four adults. the wifi and cable tv worked fine. it was easy to get around on the bus system and there's a whole foods supermarket within walking distance. all in all, no complaints at all. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend teresa's sanctuary!"
11785,1179049,2012-04-25,1871117,Férial & Nabil,great host!! we enjoyed our trip in washington!! it may be too small for 8 people but it was ok. teresa and his husband were the greatest hosts of our whole trip in the east cost. 
11785,1263814,2012-05-11,2258834,Melissa,"my 3 guests and i thoroughly enjoyed our stay at teresa's home. it was a great value! i loved the spacious kitchen that was equipped with coffee, juice, cereal and yogurt.  these are simple amenities but were appreciated. my sister and i shared the bed while my cousin and friend shared the pull out bed in the couch.  we were not in the room long enough to watch television or play the board games teresa has stocked.  

teresa was a very gracious host that is very informed about the stores and restaurants in the area.

the only negative about my experience is that the ceilings are very low.  i am 5'11 and i had to duck so as not to hit my head.  that would be the only reason i would not stay there when i return to dc with my husband in september.  he is 6'4!    "
11785,1290836,2012-05-16,2198257,Ron,had a great stay in the sanctuary near catherdral.  apartment was very nice and neighborhood is very nice.  we would have loved to stay one more night but the apartment was already rented.  we would definitely stay here again.
11785,1336851,2012-05-23,2128856,Haydee,"my family was happy. teresa and her husband gave excellent hospitality. the apartment was gorges, it is located very close to bus stop and metro, so the transportation is cheap and easily to go to the mall where are the capitol, george washington monument, white house and many museums.

my family told me after the trip to united states, it was the best place where to stay. "
11785,1353192,2012-05-26,2308971,Muthoni,"my family and i really enjoyed our stay at teresa's apartment. the apartment is close to bus lines and plenty of amenities, and teresa and reid are very attentive and accommodating hosts. highly recommended!"
11785,1431168,2012-06-07,1978856,Terri,the sanctuary at the cathedral was a perfect location for our first capital visit. we had a wonderful time while visiting the capital and knew that we would have a comfortable and restful evening each night in the apartment. our two concerns during our visit were taken care of quickly and we would stay again if we decided to make a return visit. thanks for providing the accomodations teresa and reed.
11785,1502828,2012-06-18,1858366,Josh,"teresa and reid were great hosts. we really enjoyed our stay. the apartment was within walking distance of american university where i had a conference. we were able to walk to restaurants, bars, and grocery stores on wisconsin. the set-up was great with having breakfast items fully stocked. it was great to have a washer/dryer for the week. we hardly noticed that we shared the washer/dryer with the upstairs. it was also great to have wi-fi and cable. all in all a great experience. "
11785,1598976,2012-07-01,1545821,Stefan,"this was our first stay at airbnb but certainly not our last. teresas place was just what we wanted, clean and quiet with enough place for each of us, two adults and four children.
theresa let us helpful hints for the area, restaurants, mass transit info, shopping etc. 
anything we need for our stay was there. the location was equipped with the modern life comfort. the washer and dryer we had to share with some others...
in the location there was enough place for our stuff. with the bus you need some time to came into the town. but the nightbourhood is very nice. thank you for a great stay in our holiday."
11785,1660712,2012-07-08,2326304,Michael,"the aparment is really great and fully equipped. we easilly stayed there with 5 people, too bad we didn't stay longer! they even had breakfast. the check-in was easy and the host was really kind. incredible price too! definately recommendable."

11785,1825735,2012-07-29,1834641,Joan,"what a great place to stay while vacationing in dc. this was our haven when we had walked our legs off touring the sites.  teresa and reed made our stay very enjoyable and helped us find our way on the public transportation sytems when we needed help. just a short walk from the bus stop and we were on our way to enjoy the sites. they really opened their home to us even though we were only staying in the basement apartment. the weather was extremely humid while we were there, but no one has any control over the weather. a good experience overall and their place made it even better."
11785,1858412,2012-08-01,2193425,Valérie,"a very functional and clean apartment. well located, near the washington cathedral and buses stop. the district is very chic. sympathetic hosts."
11785,1885731,2012-08-04,482576,Anton,staying with teresa and reid was one of the gratest impressions of washington and their place is definately the best place you can get. they are wonderful people and in case i'm in washington in the future i'd love to stay with them again.
11785,1911159,2012-08-07,2101773,Luc,"we are a family of four and had a excellent stay in the apartment. the basement apartment offered a cool retreat after the august heat of washington. there's plenty of space, a fully equiped kitchen and the hosts were very friendly. the apartment is located in a quiet and friendly neighbourhood."
11785,1942244,2012-08-10,2874360,Dr. Jeff,"i came to the dc area with a small group of actors to perform at a local theater and needed a clean, centrally-located, hospitable location to house us for a few days. teresa's place was one heckuva find. we were in walking distance to georgetown (restaurants, shopping, etc.) and the neighborhood was great.

reid knew the city like the back of his hand, and was very helpful with everything from directions to towel service. it was like we were all at home. if you are looking for great location, great hosts, and cleanliness, this is your spot. this was my first booking on airbnb, so i had some initial concerns about rolling the dice, but we struck gold the first time out with sanctuary near cathedral."
11785,2025463,2012-08-18,1500300,Anya,"had a wonderful stay at this place; they hosts were super friendly and helpful! many thanks, and hope to be back!"
11785,2044185,2012-08-20,3120650,Chris,we really felt at home here.  this place was so welcoming in all the thoughtful details and well appointed.  they went above and beyond anticipating our needs.  they were very knowledgeable of the area and both restaurants they recommended were excellent.  we would recommend this place to our friends in a heartbeat!
11785,2081924,2012-08-24,2798767,Severine,"very nice location, very quiet place, very comfortable appartment. totally clean.
photos really reflect the reality.
hosts are extremely welcoming, fridge was filled up with orange juice, yogurts and milk, cereals and coffee were also available which is very nice, especially when you travel by train and cannot carry a lot of food with you, no need to bother about the 1st breakfast :)
i dearly recommend this place for every group up to 4 persons.
the location is very handy to get to by bus and you are in central dc in 15 min. you can also walk to potomac river (down hill) in roughly 30mn going thru neat georgetown area.
we had an excellent stay ! to be recommended :)"
11785,2527190,2012-10-07,1999835,Judy,"my sister and i had a great time staying at santuary near cathedral teresa and reid were great hosts and nothing was too much trouble. our apartment had everything you could think of to make the stay like home from home, would certainly recommend staying there to anyone thinking of visiting washington. location is perfect, easy access to transport into the city, buy a smartrip card from cvs which you use on buses and trains and can reload at any metro station,so simple and saves you having to find correct change for fares."
11785,2581041,2012-10-11,3061338,Richard,we had a great time. excellent location. great host! 
11785,2670185,2012-10-21,3364115,Tonie,"reid and teresa were very welcoming. appreciated their info about the area and using the metro which, by the way, was great. the apartment is well decorated and comfy. the georgetown neighborhood is lovely. very safe walking even at evening. only 2 blocks to bus stop. there were a few issues with cleanliness. for the most part, they were quick to remedy our concerns. somewhat awkward to access entrance if you have mobility restrictions. overall, it was a comfortable, quiet home."
11785,3033043,2012-12-05,2277824,Kathryn,"great area, so convenient.  place was so clean, and had everything i needed.  they even left a gallon of milk, cereal and coffee!  

i feel so much gratitude that the grubers allowed me to bring my rescue pup gracie.  she loved it!  overall great experience."
11785,3088001,2012-12-14,3445020,Simon,"we loved staying at teresa and reids place. we were only there for 2 days but loved that there was yoghurt, milk and cereal provided and a large, spacious, well equipped kitchen. reid was very helpful in answering any questions we had about washington and made us feel at home in the place. "
11785,3232979,2013-01-02,2936079,Shereen,"we had a great stay at sanctuary near cathedral. the apartment suited the four of us very well and was nice and clean. everything we needed was provided, along with some helpful information! teresa and reid were very friendly and accommodating. they replied quickly to our requests - and we were grateful for the speedy responses, owing to the fact that it was new year's eve and our plans were pretty last-minute. we recommend them as hosts to everyone!"
11785,3314423,2013-01-09,718347,Laura & Jeremy,"the apartment was lovely and well equiped for our group of 3 adults and a baby.  it was nice and clean and offered room for us to spread out. 
the location is great for those who would like to enjoy what georgetown has to offer or visit the university.  we found several amenities within walking distance!
my husband is 6'7"" and therefore the height of the ceilings presented at bit of an issue for him but for ""normal"" sized people, it would not be a problem.
teresa and reed were very kind and easily approachable throughout our stay... we couldn't recommend the place enough."
11785,3370269,2013-01-19,2524448,Julia,"owners of the house teresa and reid are very nice people. we arrived before check-in time - they were allowed to leave our things, explain and tell all about what to see and how to get there. apartments are located on the first floor and has a private entrance, all as in the photos, the house is located in a very nice and prestigious area near the cathedral. apartment rates include breakfast, it was very nice). the owner gave us a ride to the airport. staying in washington was great, thank you teresa and reid!"
11785,3391265,2013-01-22,1693497,Ken,"teresa- was very responsive and helpful in our emails prior to our stay.  her place was extremely clean and well set up.  she and reid even had cereal, oj and yogurt for our breakfast!  a great airbnb experience.  ken"
11785,3410568,2013-01-25,3024307,Fiona,"teresa and reed were fantastic hosts - my two friends and i arrived to find they had left us some simple but very welcoming items like tea, milk, cereal and popcorn! made sure we had everything sorted on arrival then left us in peace to explore the basement apartment, only being disturbed when answering a question we had asked or to retrieve laundry from the shared laundry room on our level, meaning we felt we had our own little place in dc. would definitely recommend to friends and family, and if in washington another time would definitely book again! "
11785,3587174,2013-02-19,4974608,Gary,"lovely decor but, it is a basement.  the ceiling is very low.  the entrance is awkward.  you must negotiate their patio/backyard.  there is a queen size bed in the one bedroom and an extremely uncomfortable sofa bed in the livingroom.  it was so bad i had to sleep crosswise to avoid the vertical bar the first night.  they attempted to charge us $5 for an air mattress in lieu of the bed of rocks.   they have a dog they apparently train inside and a son who wears cowboy boots like he's in a marching band.  the kitchen is magnificent.  the laundry facility is convenient. "
11785,3772924,2013-03-13,4917851,Denise,"my niece melissa lives in dc ... her mom (my sister a ca resident), 2 other sisters (one from ma and one from me) along with another niece (from vt) descended on dc to see a few days in the life of melissa.  we had the time of our lives!  we used the sanctuary as our base and it was just perfect.  we loved the way the open living room/kitchen area worked for all of us to sit and chat and catch up.  we stayed up late talking and remembering how much we missed one other and being a part of every day life for each other.  our melissa has some great friends that we met at a dinner party she hosted.  we went to her workplace ""down dog yoga"" and met yet another group of nice people.  they love her and and clearly she loves them back and is very happy.  we did some sightseeing and a fair amount of shopping.  always spending a little extra time at lunch or enjoying a cupcake or waiting for someone to make a purchase to talk and laugh.  we were never more than a few feet of each other.  it was a wonderful wonderful time...  thinking it  might me a yearly thing.  "
11785,3947372,2013-03-30,4884401,Debra,"we had a nice stay here in a great neighborhood, close to the buses and reid and teresa were great!"

11785,4741419,2013-05-23,4950332,Paul,"the sanctuary was a perfect place for us to stay. near our daughter's apartment, three blocks from the wisconsin ave bus line, and a very pleasant neighborhood.  grocery stores, restaurants nearby.  the apartment work out well. spacious,clean well appointed, comfortable.  lots of handy closet space. the main bed was very comfortable.  the pullout couch bed was less so - not a surprise. was better slept. on as a couch. typical. the laundry is handy. but access from other guests in the house was through the apartment open hallway so not secure. we enjoyed meeting theresa and reid who were nice hosts. overall this was a great choice for our stay. we would stay there again. "
11785,4779726,2013-05-25,1570081,Lesa,loved the beautiful apartment and georgetown location. the owners were as friendly as could be and i really wished we'd had a chance to spend time with them.  they receive my highest recommendation.
11785,5049019,2013-06-10,1205875,Ed,"four family members stayed here over a three-day weekend to attend a graduation nearby.  the apartment was exactly as advertised, a very comfortable, fully-equipped 1 bedroom basement apartment in a secure and quiet neighborhood near the national cathedral.  the kitchen is quite well furnished with cooking utensils and we found it easy to stay in and make our own meals when we felt like it.  the hosts provide milk and a variety of cold cereals for breakfast, also some staples, spices, etc. are available for use by guests.

highly recommended for those seeking a quiet retreat when visiting dc."
11785,5142691,2013-06-15,5838785,Linda,"we had a wonderful stay at teresa gruber's apartment.  the apartment was nicely furnished and teresa and reid were very accommodating.  they stocked the kitchen with cereal, milk and orange juice which saved us a trip.  our kids stayed on the pull out bed and my husband and i were in the bedroom.  it was very comfortable.  it was also close proximity to georgetown and very easy to get to the heart of dc by mass transit.  we would definitely consider staying here again.

11785,7925619,2013-10-08,8825037,Nikki,"thank-you teresa and reid for your hospitality. the apartment was exactly as described, clean, homely and in a good location.  a well equipped kitchen with all of the essentials, available laundry and plenty of hot water. wi-fi is available which was a great help. there is a nice deck outside when the weather is nice to relax and enjoy an evening wind down after all the sightseeing walking.  it is a little trek to the national mall but no problem with the metro $3 or under or a cab for about $10-15. the cathedral is just around the corner along with the metro bus and the metro line a short walk away.  teresa and reid are fabulous hosts. we were in dc during the shutdown so our plans were thrown but teresa, reid and their friends gave us plenty of advise of other things to do. this was our first airbnb experience and i think it will be hard to beat. thanks again guys. "
11785,8086625,2013-10-15,3240752,Bob,very well located and nicely furnished... a very comfortable stay for our 4 day visit to dc to see our son who is a student at american university.  the place would have rated 5 stars except for noise from above (floor/ceiling not well insulated) and owner's use of laundry facilities during our stay... otherwise we rate this very highly!
11785,8212043,2013-10-21,8232732,Michael,the location was fantastic. we were visiting american university. the facility was modern and new. there was a $75 cleaning fee. who ever is getting $75 to clean the place is not doing there job. hope you like dogs.

11785,9014530,2013-12-02,3142574,Annette,"we rented teresa's apartment for thanksgiving and were delighted with the kitchen: lots of counter space, storage, well equipped. teresa and her husband were generous hosts and shared cooking equipment and a large card table and chairs with us for our thanksgiving dinner.  
the location was terrific, since it was minutes away from our daughter's apartment.  it was wonderful to be able to bring our dogs along and they enjoyed the large fenced-in yard.  although only my husband and i spent the night in the apartment, the space would easily accommodate a family.  
thank you for a wonderful visit!
annette & ralph "
11785,9236550,2013-12-16,7445150,Richard & Ann,"teresa and reid were pleasant hosts. teresa was kind enough to upgrade me from ""ian's room"" to this one after i needed to change my seven-night stay to four nights because of a family obligation.

the apartment was as described in the listing: spacious, comfortable, and clean (not immaculate, but certainly clean enough). i loved having a private entrance. the washer and dryer were a great convenience. in the well-equipped kitchen were cereals, yogurt, milk, and juice, which were more than sufficient for breakfast. there was plenty of hot water for morning showers. cathedral heights is a great neighborhood in which to walk, and the wisconsin and mass ave bus lines are close by.

the downside (at least for me)--also mentioned in other feedback--is that you hear, quite loudly, sounds from upstairs: walking (especially on the stairs between the 1st and 2nd floors); things being moved or dropped; music (christmas, in my case); some conversations; and perhaps even a dog barking or whining. (teresa mentions in her other, non-basement, listings that she occasionally dog-sits, but not in this one).

as she does mention in this listing, be aware that other residents can use the laundry facilities between 10a and 10p, which entails entering the apartment--whether you're there or not."
11785,9419254,2013-12-28,7199044,Stella,"we stayed with teresa and reid for four nights during christmas and enjoyed our time there so much! the apartment is spacious, clean and teresa and reid provided us with fresh towels, sheets and absolutely everything we needed - even various cereals. we also loved the amazing kitchen which is equipped with everything we could have wished for. 
public transportation is easy and you could even walk to georgetown for shopping. 
i would definitely recommend this place to everyone looking for a place to stay in d.c.. 
thank you so much, reid and teresa, for making our christmas so special!"
12442,29192,2010-03-12,87750,Johannes,"teresa was a perfect host. we stayed for 2 nights in her room ""peaches and cream"" and had a great time - it was really more than we could expect. she and her husband reid were very helpful all the time and made us feel home. we would always come back. 
just a little note: it is quite far away from the city centre, although busses and subways are within walking distance. so this should not keep you from choosing her :) "
12442,29892,2010-03-17,80896,Luanna,"teresa was great. very welcoming. the place was clean & comfortable. great bed. she was very helpful with any questions we asked and has alot of insight into dc and knows exactly how to get places.you can walk to bus & metro, also the nat.cathedral, close to everything. having a kitchen and coffee were priceless. would definitely stay there again. 3/17/10. luanna"

victoria is a very friendly and helpfull host. her cats and the lovely dog ginger are friendly too (ginger, of course, makes some noise, when somebody comes in :-))
good transport connections to every point of interest in dc, subway-station directly at the corner.
by a next trip to washington we would ask for the appartment again.

the metro (columbia heights station) is just some meters away. there is a big supermarket one block from the house. right at the corner there are shop like: cvs, target, best buy, chipotle, etc

a nice walk down to the center via 14th st.

13824,28334,2010-03-05,32079,Julia,"we stayed with chris and erin for 9 nights during late february 2010. their hospitality was wonderful. the house was light and spacious with a great kitchen dining nook overlooking the park green space which we especially appreciated. our room was comfortable, quiet, and private with its own bathroom. the wifi connection worked perfectly. we were able to come and go as we needed and we felt safe in the neighborhood at all hours. bus transportation was easily accessible, frequent during peak hours, and provided good connections to the metro. the non-express bus to federal triangle took us about 40 minutes on average during peak periods. remains of the epic winter storms somewhat limited our use of the adjacent park, but it was great place to take a walk or run. the natural setting is a beautiful feature of their location that you will enjoy! we recommend chris and erin as hosts for your stay in northwest washington dc.

13824,29890,2010-03-17,35310,Serdar,erin and chris were very friendly and there place is great. plus they took the time and gave us some great advice for the rest of our trip!! thank you ...

recommended!"
13824,30822,2010-03-22,86569,Betsy,"erin and chris were superb hosts.  the neighborhood is quiet, and the bus is a quick walk from their place, and busses come frequently.  it took me 20 minutes to get downtown.  i was treated as a friend, rather than a guest, and the accommodations were very comfortable.  this was my first airbnb experience, and it was a good one."

13824,36208,2010-04-18,69855,Conny,chris and erin went out of their way to make our stay comfortable.their home is quiet and peaceful located next to a park. you walk a few steps and there is the bus to take you downtown. i would recommend buying a smart pass online prior to coming. this saves on transportation costs and is more convenient if you are planning to take the bus and metro. chris and erin even provide you with a pass so that you can park for free on their street which is a great plus in dc. i will definitely recommend their home to my friends. thank you chris and erin!
13824,37006,2010-04-21,83128,Chandra,"we really enjoyed our stay with chris & erin.  they welcomed our family graciously and were so friendly and great to chat with.  their home was great for our needs (close enough to the city via public transit, yet still peaceful).  don't miss out on rock creek park - we enjoyed it on 2 of our days, but would have loved to explore even more.  as mentioned before - buy a smart pass!  we didn't, and kept needing bus fare.  thank you again - all was wonderful."

13824,64476,2010-07-14,98566,Juan Sebastián Hernández,"chris and erin were fabulous hosts. its very nice and cozy home. very well located to easily know the great attractions the city of washington has.
for the traveler, they offer room is comfortable and appropriate, with private bathroom, graphic and written information from the city on a shelf certainly very pretty, which is very timely for those unfamiliar with the city.

13824,96222,2010-09-13,209707,Sara,"consistent with previous reviews, erin & chris's place is terrific - very clean, spacious, and pretty. the only negative was the small size of the bed (it's full-sized), but it was definitely still worth the stay."
13824,99411,2010-09-18,114589,Dr. Bud W,"a unique couple.  we are from utah and we enjoyed the contrast and similarities of our host family.  we slept like ""rocks"" and you could literally hear a pin drop.  being by the woods was peaceful and provided a needed respite from all the nectic activity we were engage in.  a 4 point buck greeted us very closely on the trail the last afternoon.  the residence and fixtures were clean and tidy.  it was an older home but kept well.  our hosts were also very knowledgeable about the area and transportation.   we are originally from montana and were most comfortable.  bud & karen  "

14570,49850,2010-06-05,104508,Greg,"we enjoyed our stay at serge's apartment very much.  the room is spacious, light and lovely, and everything in the home is very tasteful.  serge himself was a pleasure to meet and interesting to talk to, but also gave us just the right amount of privacy.  the apartment (particularly the bathroom) has some small issues that are the sort one expects in older buildings with character, but they might annoy less adventurous folks."

14570,53102,2010-06-14,131007,Chulwoo,"first, i am not a native english speaker and came to dc for my work in smithsonian. and this is the first visiting to dc which means absolutely stranger here.

all the contacts i have made before i visited was great. he replied me in a short time and the answers were perfect.

about the house, from the union station 6$ taxi, 9th and n st. then easy to find.
when i got there, it was friday night and noisy, a bit worried but this place is so quiet and pleasant. (simply, it is white based a beautiful room)

location: great to go to the national mall, less than 10 mins by bus which you can get just around the corner from his house. and to 14th, 17th and dupont circle are walkable.

i definately will stay again, if i have another chance to come.

enjoy your staying."
14570,53928,2010-06-17,106685,Peter,"serge's house is in a great location for visiting washington, meaning we were able to walk from the house to all the sights of the city. the room was clean, comfortable and a really good size. although we didn't meet serge as he was out of town with work, he sent us a long list of recommended places to eat, which we really enjoyed, and serge had everything well organised so that everything went totally smoothly with our vist. we would definitely recommend staying with serge."
14570,57646,2010-06-27,97586,Jordan,"serge was a great host and the room had everything we needed. an aerobed was available for my 9-year-old son and the kitchen was stocked for breakfast. serge was very responsive to emails and even helped us out over the phone when he was out of town and we accidentally got locked out of our room.

the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is little eating or sightseeing activities in the immediate neighborhood. but there is a lot available once you walk about 5-10 block. plus, the yellow/green line metro stop is only a few blocks away and then it's only 2 stops to u street or the mall. would definitely stay with serge again."
14570,61564,2010-07-06,86717,Wendy,"we had a great time in washington with a perfect stay at serge's house. the large room with bathroom and toilet is comfortable and clean and the neighbourhood is very quiet. the location is not far from the city center. serge had some interesting suggestions for our visit as well!

14570,64860,2010-07-15,137426,Fred,"our stay at serge's place was everything we hoped for. the space is terrific. even though the temp was in the high 90s on several days, the air conditioning kept the interior cool and comfortable. an aerobed was available for my daughter. there was milk, juice, coffee, tea and cereal for great morning breakfasts. the apartment is also wonderfully located: we were able to walk to a different restaurant every night - to u street, china town, and k street. btw, if you need a rental car, there's a rent-a-wreck franchise in blagden alley, about 10 yards from serge's place. based on serge's advice we rented a car there at the last minute and the service was excellent. serge is a gracious host, eager to help and provide suggestions. we're most pleased to recommend his place.

we enjoyed meeting serge and were made to feel quite welcome.
we will recommend these accomodations to our friends."
14570,112732,2010-10-06,154263,David,"i came to dc to carry out a series of interviews as part of a research project on global health and stayed at serge's place for 8 days. it was my first experience with air bnb and it was just brilliant. serge offered great advice on restaurants, etc. he arraged for me to get the key as he was not around when i came. actually, he was there only one evening as he was then working out of town on a project. the place is very central. dupont circle and 14th street with its restaurants, whole food, etc are within walking distance. the underground is a block away. for those doing the tourist tour, capitol hill, the mall, etc are also walkable. and, last but not least, the place itself is really great - furniture and the flat itself are done arranged with amazing good taste. brilliant (and that is  from someone who is generally difficult to please)! thank you serge!"
14570,115330,2010-10-10,223155,Marlene,"we had a great stay, serge was not there, but he gave us excellant instructions on getting in the apartment and what areas we could walk to for food. it was so nice to stay in a neighborhood not surrounded by other hotels, and tourist restaurants. it is very close to a metro stop but you can also walk to some sites as well. we enjoyed feeling like we had a ""home"" to go back to at night, not just another hotel room. serge had breakfast food available, and we were also able to use the refridgerator.  i play to try to stay here again on future trips. thanks so much !!"
14570,119244,2010-10-14,254247,Matthias,"thank you for 3 wonderful days / nights in washington dc. . unfortunately we didn’t met serge during our visit, but we will catch this up next time! the whole procedure (get contact, information, ...) was very stressless, serge gave us good instructions via telephone (and good recommendations for dinner too). the apartment was very clean, the refigerator was in best conditions, the bathroom was clean ..., in total: excellent!  the location of the apartment is very close to downtown (or it is downtown), so that we could walk to all the sights by foot. so to everybody who is interested to stay one ore more nights in washington dc. ... to stay in this place is a very good option. 
@serge: see you the next time!"
14570,120457,2010-10-17,120989,Laura,"our stay at serge's place was great. he has a very nice appartement and it's not far from all the monuments, the white house, etc. and in his vicinity there are great restaurants and bars."
14570,124161,2010-10-22,155275,Kim,"i had a wonderful time in dc. serge's place is just as he states...clean, conveniently located and in a safe friendly area. as a host it does not get better than serge. he readily answers all calls and e-mails and is very knowledgeable about dc and surrounding area. yes, i would definately reccommend staying at serge's place when in town, i would stay there again.

"
14570,126973,2010-10-25,259059,Lana,"our stay went just as hoped: the room and bed were comfortable, the neighborhood and metro were safe and convenient and serge was a gracious host - kind and helpful when you needed it, quiet or gone when you didnt.  it was our first airbnb experience, and we'll definitely do it again - such a refreshing change from sterile, cookie cutter hotels!"
14570,130208,2010-10-31,189807,Florian,"nice guy, clean and cosy room, felt very comfy.

this house is situated very central, only a short walk to all important sightseeing places, restaurants, shops, metro station..

i would definitely recommend anyone to stay at serge's place.
best deal you can get for your money."
14570,141680,2010-11-20,224487,Gerard,"really nice stay, serge is a friendly and knowledgeable host and provided lots of useful local info including some excellent travel options which saved us 200$ !! check out (website hidden by airbnb) if you are travelling in the ny/dc area. his house is very clean, lots of natural light and breakfast is available. locationwise it's just a 10 min walk to town or a few minutes to the metro and within easy reach of a good supermarket (whole foods on p street)and some good bars and restaurants.  "
14570,147958,2010-12-02,235869,Nick,great spacious room with private bathroom. clean and quiet. nice host. breakfast included! lots of nice restaurants within 5-10 minute walk. would stay here again.

this is simply because i had a great time at serge's place.  he is a great guy, extraordinarily kind and friendly.  

the place is very clean, and the area is very safe and convienient.

i'd highly recommend this place to my close friends and family."
14570,157188,2010-12-22,275249,CNC Studio Digital,we stayed 3 nights at serge´s flat and it was a real nice experience. beautiful apartment. very clean. spacious and very illuminated room. serge was very discrete but all the time available for any needs. the location is in a very quiet and peaceful area. we definitively recommend this place. thanks serge.
14570,159820,2010-12-29,285503,Mike & Sabrina,"our experience at serge's place was fantastic.  it was exactly what we were looking for, a do-it-yourself style vacation.  being close to the metro, even walking distance to downtown made it really convenient to stop back and take a rest or a shower if we felt like it.  serge gave very clear instructions and was very kind, he wasn't there at all during our stay but made sure we had everything we needed.  it all went very smoothly and we had no complaints at all.  
mike and sabrina"
14570,166051,2011-01-05,264091,Mike,"we were guests of serge for 7 nights. the accommodation was spacious, clean and comfortable, light and bright.  serge was very friendly and most helpful in getting us settled in and orientated.  we were able to get to the mall easily on either the 52 or 54 bus from 14th street, a few blocks away, so did not need to walk too far or use the metro (which is also conveniently close-by, but slightly more expensive).   we had everything we needed and had a most enjoyable stay. we would stay here again if ever in dc. thanks, serge. "
14570,168842,2011-01-10,312511,Don,"serge's place was quiet and super comfortable. all the modern, and very organized, amenities are there. the room was huge. i was also able to walk to dupont, u st. and the mall! don't miss out on this immaculate home."
14570,170213,2011-01-13,113227,Matt,"our stay at serge's place was very last minute. however serge was very responsive to our email to check his availability. serge was very helpful & thorough with the directions & instructions for our stay. he has a beautiful place. the bedroom is huge, perfect for the luggage we had accumulated over the time we were travelling. the bed is very comfortable. the location is perfect, we walked our way around dc in 2 days. we would have loved to stay longer, unfortunately the room was booked out.
serge is a great guy. would have loved to spend more time with him.
thanks again serge. would highly recommend."
14570,173443,2011-01-22,95347,Chad,serge was a great host and the place was as nice as the photos make it out to be. he was a great help when i had to find a clothing store to pick up some extra undershirts (packed a little too quickly). looking forward to staying here again next time i'm in dc. 
14570,176214,2011-01-30,350898,Libby,"first off - hands down most comfortable bed i have ever slept in besides my own! gracious host, beautiful room and location was just right for walking to all the musuems and sights. will stay again when in dc."
14570,183377,2011-02-16,152558,Chrystiane,"i had an incredibly smooth stay at serge's, from start to finish: he was available to answer questions and even sent shuttle recommendations from the airport; i had no problems finding or getting into the place despite his absence; he checked in by email after my arrival; the place itself was even better than the pictures, with a remarkably comfy bed for airbnb (and i've had a lot of stays by now), excellent central heating and air, good cable and tv, incredibly large space for dc, and great printed instructions and advice on the neighborhood.  the neighborhood is the hottest one in which to stay in dc presently - i know this because i spent the week apartment-hunting, and my friends recommended that very area.  don't stay anywhere else if this place is available."
14570,188232,2011-02-25,361863,Sabrina,"serge is a wonderful host, who manages to be simultaneously engaging and discreet. he has created a spotless downtown haven filled to the brim with warmth, books, and art (seriously, to wake up and find yourself staring at a kertész ... what a treat!). after a day filled with meetings and museums, it was a joy to return to the comfort of his home for a cup of tea, a good book, and a great chat. i heartily recommend this property to anyone seeking a true urban retreat."
14570,191304,2011-03-02,225030,Yann,"serge gave us a very warm welcome in a lovely and quiet place, close to washington city center and attractive neighborhoods.

serge also guided us very well for our arrival and during our stay which has been most helpful!

we highly recommend travellers willing to spend a couple of days in a nice, quiet, clean and easy-to-access place in washington to contact serge!"
14570,193632,2011-03-07,373492,Bruce,"my wife and i had a very nice stay at serge's. the apartment is a few blocks from the metro station. it is in a gentrifying area with new galleries and coffee shops. 

the apartment is light, clean and the bedroom has many interesting books to flip through. serge is a very busy man who has many stories to tell from his international travel. 

"
14570,196564,2011-03-11,378709,Gay,"the room was spacious and clean. the private bath was new and well-maintained. serge was the best. he made a special trip to the market to buy lactose-free milk and allowed access to his kitchen, which is equipped with a microwave oven and toaster. i do not recall whether there are electric burners but definitely there is no oven. i enjoyed chatting with serge so much over breakfast on my first morning in his home that i was quite late for my conference. serge is a wonderful host, unobtrusive yet very charming. the location is a few blocks from the convention center. if you have dietary issues (like lactose intolerance) let serge know and he will do his best to ensure that you have something you can eat for breakfast. highly recommended!"""
14570,199477,2011-03-15,294305,Henry,"great place, great host. very artistic design of the unit, and, yes, lots of books! the bed is really comfortable. the location is very nice with about 20-30 min walk to capitol area, and is close to the metro which is about 7min walk if public transport is preferred. bicycle renting is also available nearby, which is a great way to travel in dc. thank you serge!"
14570,202389,2011-03-18,112228,Sonny,"wonderful host, very helpful, clean and convenient place to stay..will definitely stay again"
14570,204434,2011-03-21,335383,Cindy,"serge was a wonderful host, extremely helpful with directions and printed lists of what to see in the neighborhood, and provided an aesthetically dynamic apartment with lots of natural light, and wonderful books of art, architecture, and travel. the room is spacious, bright, very quiet, and clean. 
the neighborhood is central to walking anywhere in the city. highly recommended... thank you serge!
"
14570,209212,2011-03-26,406523,Marion,"serge's place is inviting, clean and very aesthetically pleasing - lovely. (truly looks just like the photos.)  my daughter and i stayed for 4 nights. serge was overseas, so we did not have the pleasure of meeting him, but everything was provided for and household information/directions/helpful hints/etc. were clearly spelled out. prior to our arrival, serge's email correspondences concerning planning and any questions were always prompt, friendly and charming. i am quite fussy/finicky and this was my first experience with airbnb. the fact that i would return to serge's and recommend his place and airbnb to others is a testament to serge's hosting style and his gracious accommodations."
14570,213593,2011-03-31,340153,Brittany,"we didn't get to meet serge because he was out of town during our stay.  however, his place was beautiful and he was more than helpful in planning our trip details, etc.  i would highly recommend staying at this spot!"
14570,216443,2011-04-04,342671,Madeline,"although my friend and i did not meet serge in person, his dc accommodations were very comfortable and conveniently located to all the places we needed and wanted to go. we would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this clean and reasonably priced place. merci serge!"
14570,220313,2011-04-08,340764,Connie,"what a beautiful apartment - clean, bright, spacious bedroom and ensuite bath. perfect. we were in a lovely area of washington, about a half hour walk from the mall. serge was away during our visit, but we had no problems because the instructions left were very clear.

14570,221790,2011-04-10,290543,George,"serge is an extraordinary person, extremely nice and cares a lot about guests. the clean spacious room with private bath, the generous breakfast and the location of the room made my stay as if at five star hotel. many thanks serge."
14570,233719,2011-04-21,314611,Iain & Cathy,"serserge was out of town so we didn't get to meet him but that did not detract from our visit to washington dc.  his place is just like the photos and the bedroom is very large which is a bonus if you have some luggage.  breakfast was continental with juice, bagels, grain bread etc so ample for us.  we found the location excellent with the subway a block or so away, but the red circulator bus which takes you down to national mall which is the main strip with all the museums and monuments, is just around the corner.  "
14570,245140,2011-04-30,395777,Dennis,"my wife and i had a wonderful stay in dc at serge's apartment.  it is exactly as described and pictured.   we did not meet serge as he was out of town during our stay, but his prompt and detailed emails made our check in and stay easy.   the bedroom is large and bright with a private bath.  there is a brilliant skylight over the dining table for you when you eat your provided breakfast.  we always felt safe in this neighborhood.  we used the metro ( about 3 blocks)  and the red buss (even closer) to get to the sights.    we even walked to ford's theater and the mall.   in short,   this is an outstanding place to stay for your visit to dc."
14570,256672,2011-05-09,333123,Mary,"we stayed four days in the quiet, bright and sunny ensuite bedroom in serge's beautiful apartment in an interesting neighbourhood. serge was the perfect host leaving us to our own devices, but there any time we needed him. all that was required for an ample and nutritious breakfast  was provided. it was a short walk to the metro and buses, and to neighbourhood restaurants recommended by serge. if we were lucky enough to return to washington, we'd certainly be in touch with airbnb and serge again."
14570,260502,2011-05-12,353792,Isacco,"the apartment is centrally located in a beautifull neighborhood.
serge is a great host, always kind and willing to help guests. i reccomend this place !"
14570,264975,2011-05-16,359690,Howard,enjoyed the bnb very much. i would definitely recommend and will definitely stay whenever i am in dc again. was able to choose between walking to the mall museums (in 15 mins) or take the metro 2 blocks away. very handy location to good eateries on p and 14th (only 4 blocks away). huge bedroom at back of the apartment overlooking (by one floor) a large communal style quiet courtyard. bed was super comfortable and bathroom was ultra clean. serg's collection of books and movies (along one bedroom wall) should delight anyone with a passion for eclectic literature. the continental breakfast was wonderful and very healthy on which to start the day. definitely a great option for dc accommodation.
14570,281565,2011-05-26,99448,Allan,"this apartment was ideal for a visit to d.c.  we attended an event at the convention center two blocks away.  the location was perfect.  we never saw serge, who was travelling, but he kept in contact and was available should the need arise.  it didn't.  

the apartment was clean and comfortable.  we changed our own sheets and towels.  there was adequate food and toiletries.

the only shortcoming was the absence of air conditioning, a problem as the city became quite warm.  serge said he's installing air conditioning soon.

we'd happily stay here again with the proviso that air conditioning is functioning.

"
14570,296513,2011-06-04,398975,Elena,good location and charming host - he helped us with good informations do-see in town. very nice - we definetly would stay again and we strongly recommend it.
14570,315693,2011-06-15,488553,Nick,"our 7 night stay was our  first experience of using airbnb and proved a very positive one. the location giving easy access to downtown dc was a major plus and the accomodation was comfortable and had all the facilities that were advertised. our host was as urbane and cultivated as you would expect from a man about the metro capital and gave useful practical advice on things such as overnight parking and local amenities.

14570,326065,2011-06-21,412978,Debbie,"we had a wonderful stay at serge's home.  unfortunately we didn't get to meet with him as he was traveling on business however, his home was wonderful and he was an excellent host.  the apartment is incredibly well located, ony 3 blocks from the metro station and we found it a perfect starting point for all our visits in d.c.   we even caught a soccer game at rfk stadium which was easy to get to on the metro.   we walked to whole foods and picked up groceries and ate at some wonderful restaurants serge  had recommended only  a short walk from the apartment.  the apartment itself was just lovely and had everything you could need for a comfortable stay.   this was our first airbnb exsperience and it was 5 star!  we are already talking about a return to dc to see all the things we simply couldn't accomplish in only 5 days and hope to be able to stay with serge again when we do!"
14570,347157,2011-07-02,382823,Robyn,"this was our first airbnb experience and our first time in dc.  we had a great time.  besides me, i had my two sons, ages 13 & 14.  serge was very helpful and available by phone when he wasn't at the house.  i was disappointed that the oven/stove top didn't work, but it worked out okay because we were so exhausted when we got home each evening, i didn't really feel like cooking.  and by microwaving dinner, i had less dishes to do.  i will definitely try airbnb again and i hope to get back to dc sometime - it's a beautiful city."
14570,370579,2011-07-13,46880,Victoria,bravissimo!
14570,398107,2011-07-26,694373,Petrus,"it was our first experience with airbnb and we loved it!
"
14570,416773,2011-08-03,313199,Iliana,"my husband and i stayed in serge's apt for 5 full days. he was away on business and took care of some minor problems for us as not having internet and tv not working.
i loved the apt., every picture posted is exactly how the place is ( only pix not posted is the stairway going up to the living area.) 
he had the fridge stocked well with breakfast items for us, milk , cereal, bread, juice, jam, butter. 
the location can't be beat.. a couple of blocks to restaurants and jerry chan's chinese take out on 13th st.  a couple to a grocery store, ozzie's cafe, ( delicious smoothies), another half a block to the circulator bus on 9th st. and one more to m street to the green and yellow metro station.
the bed was roomy ( a queen) and comfy blankets and soft sheets and pillow casee, lots of toiletries available in the bathroom ;soap, shampoo etc. shower did not have a curtain but a towel on the floor solved the water splashing out. the shower head and the water pressure was great. he also left us directions as to where to find sheets and towels in a storage pantry.
 you also have ac in your bedroom and the dining area and fans in the rooms where you can use to circulate the air better. there are 2 sky lights into the living and dining area which make the place quite bright.  it was very quiet and did not hear any noise from either neighbors or on the street. wish we had met serge , maybe next time. thanks again.. it was a great stay."
14570,440929,2011-08-13,21423,Virginia,serge was especially great about setting up clear communications and detailed instructions that made everything go smoothly. the apt is well-equipped and comfortable and very convenient to the convention center.
14570,452623,2011-08-17,339551,Michele,"serge's home is wonderful, well located and fully equipped.
even though i didn't meet serge, he let us feel comfortable in his house."
14570,478177,2011-08-27,688637,Mike,"serge is great.  he was only there the last night of our stay, but it felt like he was there the entire time.   after providing us with a list of local activities/places about a week beforehand, he checked in to make sure all was going well.   

positives:
* serge and his hospitality
* really close to the metro - 3 blocks/5 minutes
* near grocery stores, restaurants and bars
* the house is great - organized for airbnb travelers.  instructions everywhere in the house, anything you need (basically) is there.
* nice and comfortable bed and bedroom with private bath

negatives:
* stove/oven doesn't work.   i think serge put that there is no hot food available in the ad.   must have not connected ""no hot food"" = ""non working stove/oven"".    we figured out a solution with the microwave, but it was suboptimal.    (note:  suggestion was given to serge regarding how to re-phrase the ad.)
* 2nd floor/small staircase.   didn't realize it was on the second floor.  schlepping 2 x 50 lb pieces of luggage up a narrow flight of stairs with a pregnant wife in tow was a bit of a challenge.  not major, but something to be aware of.

note:  even with these two ""negatives"", i highly recommend staying with serge.   he made it easy."
14570,499189,2011-09-04,400624,Dianne,"serge was a friendly, helpful host,  who answered all our questions about washington but also left us to our own devices - a perfect balance. the accommodation was as descirbed on airbnb, - clean, comfortable and location excellent. many thanks for helping to make our week in washington a wonderful one!"
14570,514941,2011-09-09,529760,Jan,"the room + bathroom offered by serge is a very nice place to stay and one feels ""at home"" very soon. also, serge is a great host who has experience with hosting guests so that we already had all information before we actually needed them. we definitely recommend staying here!"
14570,538171,2011-09-17,462225,Patricia,"serge's apartment is a great place from which to explore central washington, there is a circulator bus just round the corner on 9th street that gets you to the mall for $1 which we used many times, the bedroom is large, the bed is comfortable..despite serge not being there, he provided everything we needed. thanks "
14570,572968,2011-09-27,350243,Maureen,"my friend maureen and i shared the bedroom and it worked out great. one of us slept on the bed, and the other on the aerobed that serge provided. both were comfortable with clean linens and pillows provided. the bedroom is spacious and well decorated. we were able to watch cable tv, listen to our ipod using serge's speaker, and use ac when it was humid. the bathroom is cute and has a nice tiled shower. toiletries like soap and shampoo were provided as well as a hairdryer. serge provided juice, milk, bread, peanut butter, jam, cereal, and fruit for breakfast. i am not generally a breakfast eater, but it was nice to enjoy a small bite to start our day. also tea and fresh ground coffee (and coffee press) were provided for a caffeine fix! the location is convenient to metrorail, metrobus, and circulator bus. also, it is easy walking distance to u street and chinatown. there are lots of great nearby restaurants from which to choose. serge is very pleasant and gracious! he had lots of great written information about the area, and also gave good advise regarding restaurants, stores, transportation, etc. i appreciated all the detailed information he emailed before we got there, and how easy he is to work with.

i was definitely happy with our accommodations and feel fortunate that
we had such a wonderful host! i highly recommend serge and airbnb.

serge is an extraordinary person in many ways: a very interesting man, a wonderful host always attentive to his guests needs,very helpful and responsive. one can hardly imagine a better host.
we cannot think of. washington dc. without staying again at his place."

i really can't say or praise him enough as his hospitality is ""5 star""..
the home is just as the photos show, there's coffee, milk, juice and toast awaiting you.. oh and the coffee is very good.. u just have to grind the beans. thank you serge for accepting our enquiry and making our trip to dc very memorable...

14570,677345,2011-11-01,450793,Nancy,"my stay in serge's home was very very comfortable. the location is perfect, the room (home) is very accurately depicted in the pictures and talk about clean! 

also, serge perfectly lays out the ""hows"" for your stay. my directions for check in could not have been clearer and easier to follow. once inside everything is very nicely explained should you have any questions. 

add to this the availability of serge at all times. he is very communicative and upon emailing or calling him he was always quick to respond. 

the walk to the metro from this location is about three blocks. aside from that there are a whole assortment of restaurants, stores etc very nearby.

i'm planning on a trip back to dc in the near future. should serge's home be available during my dates of travel (tbd) i am booking right away! 

"
14570,696723,2011-11-06,236530,Wendy & David,"all the reports that i received from paul, the person i had stay with serge were positive.  he and i spoke after the stay and he seems like  a stand-up guy that takes pride in his home.  "
14570,709100,2011-11-11,1094520,Jamie,"serge was great, and so was his place. first a bit about our host: serge is a super cool guy, artistic, and actually a pleasure to interact with. he has an interesting life, is articulate, and very polite. his place is super cool too: modern, sophisticated, comfortable, and very clean. we enjoyed our stay with serge very much, and would certainly come back and do it again. "
14570,723608,2011-11-16,296781,Gregory,serge is great and the room is very clean and quiet. great place if you are working at the convention center

14570,747805,2011-11-27,936174,Guri,"i stayed at serge's apartment with a friend of mine for a mini-weekend in dc. serge was out of town, but he provided us with all the information we needed to make the stay perfect. the apartment is beautiful, clean and has the perfect location to explore the city. we truly recommend it!"
14570,776382,2011-12-11,950478,Delphine,"serge's place is exactly what is depicted in the pictures - chic, clean and spacious. serge has made my first airbnb stay very comfortable, and although my husband and i did not get a chance to meet him, serge was very helpful and timely in replying our queries via emails. 
the location of his place is perfect - with the main sights and sounds a short walk away. "
14570,790770,2011-12-18,899129,Gessjca,"this place simply made my stay. first of all it was a pleasure for my eyes. you want to go around barefoot on the spotless, warm wooden floor and carpet; you desire to read lying on the immaculate sofa, looking at the natural light coming from the ceiling. oh yeah! 
everything is exactly as pictured and explained and if any help is needed, serge is present and warm, even if miles away as in my case. 
considering his home, i thought he would have been one of this person i immediately link with. location is also good and feels safe: a nice walk to a bunch of cool places at night or everything you want to see in washington during the day. just go and enjoy!
"
14570,841775,2012-01-06,244222,Kehau,"nothing could have been better!

14570,857006,2012-01-11,1528551,Jim,"great location for visiting downtown washington, close enough to walk to the trolley and metro stops and far enough away to find numerous dining choices. serge unfortunately was away, but his instructions where clear and it was easy finding and getting settled in. large quiet room with a great comfortable bed, we would definitely stay here again.

thanks serge,

the location was good, and there is a brilliant diner about 15 minutes away on foot for breakfast (florida bar & grill) on florida avenue, which was one of the highlights of our usa trip. recommended. "
14570,889417,2012-01-29,358010,Brian,"i was in dc for a professional meeting some 5 blocks south of serge's apartment.  fyi, the conference was charging $275 per night for a room.  i was able to walk to and fro safely rather late at night, and had no trouble finding nourishment nearby based on serge's recommendations.  the apartment itself is spotless, the bed is comfortable, and the arrangements w/serge to arrive and depart were quick and painless.  i only wish i could have stayed a little longer."

the location was exactly what we wanted.  it was an easy walk to restaurants, bars, and a metro station.  

the bed was super comfy, and the bathroom had all that we needed.  i forgot that the room had an hd tv with direct tv linked to it, but it was a welcome surprised to come back and relax to a bit of tv before passing out from our day's adventures.  we had no problem sleeping in each morning - the shades blocked out most of the light (super private) and you couldn't hear any noise from the street.

the breakfast options were great - three different kinds of milk, three different kind of coffee, two kinds of cereal, juice and bread.  and some fresh fruit.  perfect!  

everything was clean and tidy - exactly as we expected.  although we only had the pleasure of speaking with serge briefly at the beginning of our trip, he was friendly and answered all of our questions.  he is a wonderful host.

i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for quiet, convenient, and comfortable place to stay."

if we ever come back to dc we will first ask serge to stay in his appartment, that's sure! thank you."

14570,2502091,2012-10-04,1201148,Bonnie,"my husband and i had a wonderful 10 night stay at serge's apartment and enjoyed the experience tremendously. serge is really the perfect, gracious host. we enjoyed both our privacy and the opportunity for  interesting conversation with our well traveled host. 

yes, there's the french pressed coffee and continental breakfast materials, the extremely comfortable bed, lots of hot water and shower pressure, the clean and visually pleasing space (identical to the photos), the very large bedroom and private bath with room to really unwind and  be comfortable after a long day of seeing the many sights in this historic city, and the air conditioning that saved us as the weather was hot and humid during our visit.  wifi access was great. the capitol mall is easily walkable from serge's location. we bought a 7 day metro pass as i developed  nasty blisters on the first day from a poor shoe choice as i sprinted over to my congressman's office for a tour of the capitol building. imagine my delight in finding moleskin and scissors in the bathroom!  i was able to moleskin my feet and resume enjoying the museums and sights. very appreciated! 

we listened to crickets while falling asleep at night less than a mile from the white house. 

don't stay anywhere else if serge's booking calendar shows availability. i am so tickled that i found his listing. we had a relaxing, memorable stay and yes, yes, yes, we hope to book with serge again!

14570,2669048,2012-10-21,2622083,Hannes,"our stay at serge's place was wonderful. serge was away so we had the whole place to ourselves. the apartment is very tastefully decorated and has a homey feel. everything was just perfect and exactly as described. 
also the location is great. even on the map it looks a little out of the way when you are used to manhattan dimensions, in fact everything is very close. you can walk e.g. to the national mall within 15-20 min. as the distances are so small we never event took the subway which if you want is just 5 min away. 
the neighborhood seems very safe at least we did not have a single strange or unpleasant encounter. 
many restaurants close by either on 14th street or around chinatown. 

all in all a great stay with an exceptional value. "

the room is just beautiful!  the bed - seriously, the most comfortable bed and pillows i have ever slept on!!  i loved the wall of books and would stay there again just to lie in bed all day and read from his wide selection!
all in all, i would have no hesitation in highly recommending this room and the host.  thanks for a wonderful stay."

14570,4230548,2013-04-21,1443205,Linda,"serge was an excellent host ... very responsive even in absentia.  we enjoyed his quiet, roomy spot to relax between daily metro trips to the various dc attractions.  the room has a very comfy bed. one wall is filled with books, cd's and dvd's. loved all the dimmer switches throughout.  the private bath more than filled our needs.  the cereal and milk/juice were already waiting for us when we arrived, and we added a few things to the fridge from a grocery store 1 1/2 blocks away.  entry instructions were easy and neighborhood nice. it was a quick 7 minute walk to the metro. he emailed us good instructions for taxi service on our way back to the airport.  we would definitely stay with serge on another trip to dc.  the harrison's, from north carolina"
14570,4356721,2013-04-30,3119905,Roy,"serge's lovely and comfortable flat was the perfect place for us (a west coast couple in our mid-60s) to stay for six nights while exploring the washington dc area on foot.  it was just as advertised in the listing - quiet, clean, spacious, private, and stocked with ample continental breakfast materials - and its location was a very walkable distance from all necessary amenities as well as to downtown dc, the white house, and the national mall.  it was an easy metro ride from reagan national and the dc circulator bus stop is just a few blocks away if local transportation is needed.  unfortunately, serge was traveling during our visit, but his comprehensive instructions and information along with subsequent pre-trip communication made checking in and out extremely easy even in his absence.  we will definitely recommend serge's place to family and friends and will keep our fingers crossed that it is available for booking when we return to dc for future rest and relaxation.  thanks, serge, for hosting us.  our stay in your home was a great experience, and we hope to get to meet you in the future.

and when we arrived we were so suprised to discover a beautiful appartement! 
our room was very confortable and  serge gave us some very good advice about the city!
and as we say in french "" la cerise sur le gâteau"", serge's french is perfect!
thanks a lot! i reccomand!"
14570,4658850,2013-05-19,4934454,Stewart And Linda,"the pre arrival communication with serge was immediate and comprehensive.  instructions were complete and easy to follow.  all our requests were immediately addressed.

the location is ideal for a first time visitor to washington dc.  great restaurants nearby and a close walk to major attractions.

14570,4963904,2013-06-04,1732227,Armin & Diana,"we stayed at serge's place during a hot june weekend in dc and could not have asked for a nicer host. he was very responsive and friendly via email in preparation of the trip - despite being in between his own travels. 

for the price, the apartment is an absolute steal since you have your own bathroom and a kitchen with breakfast (great french press coffee) which is provided by serge. a subway stop as well as capital bikeshare station is located within 5 minutes, so you are in the city in no-time. 

we also finally met serge on the last day of our stay and had a great long chat. his place will definitely be our no.1 address for future stays in dc. "
14570,5017936,2013-06-08,4993994,Helen,"i am a senior solo female traveller. i stayed for four nights. i had difficulty accessing the key. i managed to open the first metal secure door with the combination lock code but failed to release the key to the second door, following documented instructions.  i feel a more detailed instructions are required eg a photo and diagram would be useful. fortunately serge came to put the rubbish out and saved the day. serge was not answering his phone. serge did apologise for not having his phone nearby.

the room, bed and facilities were tasteful and comfortable. the room was a little stuffy as windows could not be opened. an air conditioner that blew air in on a set timer worked and a rotating electric fan replaced fresh air. 

i would have liked to have an internal lock / security lock on my bedroom door, that i could have locked at night.

the location was fine, i mostly walked. dc is a walking town. i felt safe at all times walking to and from this b&b.

overall it was a good, quiet and clean place to stay.  serge provides a lot of information re transport,  places of interest in dc as well  as a very useful first aid kit. breakfast supplies were more than adequate for me.

serge is a friendly, interesting and non intrusive host and we had a nice chat on the morning i left.

i asked serge whether to visit the phillips collection or visit the textiles museum. serge said the phillips collection and it was a good call. thanks serge, what a fabulous collection to see prior leaving dc. the gallery also has a good coffee shop.

thanks serge!

dc. it has a perfect location, and the house is clean and beautiful, just as pictures. although serge was out of town, he left everything in order when we arrived. he was always on the lookout for our stay and gave us advises for different places and restaurants to visit. couldn't' be more perfect!  
i definitively recommend serge's house for staying in dc. thank's a lot :)










"
14570,9417206,2013-12-27,5200207,Margaret,"i have only positive things to say about this experience with airbnb. i contacted serge around the holidays and he was quick to respond to my inquiry. i was in need of accommodations in dc because of an accident my father had been involved in and i needed to be in the city. serge was very understanding and made sure i had all of the information i needed to check in. the apartment is in a beautiful part of dc (i know because i was born and raised here) within walking distance to banks, a grocery store and plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops. public transportation and taxis are within walking distance as well. the apartment itself is clean, quiet, has a great vibe and was such a reprieve from a busy schedule. the room is huge, comfortable and i had an incredible night's rest! everything went well and i am super grateful. awesome space for those traveling to dc for various reasons! serge himself is kind and welcoming too! thank you!"
16684,24329,2010-01-18,66885,Courtney,"matt and jean's apartment is easily the best deal in dc. it is a convenient walk to union station, national mall, the capitol, etc. there is a food mart and coffee shop directly across the street (which we didn't even need to utilize thanks to the abundance of food and beverages our hosts left for us). the apartment itself is beautiful and better than any hotel we could have stayed at. jean was extremely helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. this was more than we could have asked for and we definitely plan on staying here the next time we visit dc! courtney and jon cincinnati, oh"
16684,24611,2010-01-22,70545,Kate,"5 stars!! would be our top recommendation to anyone traveling to dc- for luxurious comfort (the bed especially!) and atmosphere and location...and most of all for jean and her husband's hospitality-the coffee, breakfast, fireplace, quality linens, restaurant and neighborhood information...truly delightful and perfect. we can't wait to return! "
16684,24673,2010-01-23,71176,Judi,"we had a 5 star plus experience staying at jean and matt's place--they are the sweetest people ever and so
helpful and accommodating; their place is immaculate,
beautiful and comfortable--we only wished they were not
booked, as we would have have stayed much longer.  this
is our #1 recommendation to anyone staying in dc.

16684,24889,2010-01-26,66904,Mary,"i loved staying here! clean, comfortable, and great location (everything was within walking distance or a short bus ride). they have thought of everything -i really appreciated all the snacks/breakfast items, visitor guides/maps, and hot running water. jean and matt were extremely nice and helpful hosts. jean even gave me a ride to an audition early one morning and didn't flinch at my clarinet practicing in between. i felt safe and at home and would definitely recommend staying here!  "
16684,25642,2010-02-07,72207,Liva,"we had the best experience staying at jean and matt's guest suite! if we go back to dc in the near future, we are definitely hoping to stay there again. "
16684,27078,2010-02-21,20283,Kayla,"perfect!  i know that sounds a bit cliché but it literally was perfect.  jean and matt are wonderful people, very friendly, always ready to meet our needs in a second, and fun to talk to.  it was my first time staying in something like this, i'm use to hotels, and it's safe to say that i will probably never go back to another hotel again when going to dc.  location is always key when booking a place, so trust me, you will not be disappointed when you book this historic basement suite because it's so close to everything.  for example, walk down the street towards union station (where the metro and train station are) and you will see the huge white capitol building.  i can't express how grateful i am to have found a place like this with amazing people to accommodate us, talk about relaxing.  can't wait to go back!  oh and did i mention they even made a big heart our of little hershey kisses on our bed and placed a bottle of martinelli's in the fridge?  it was romantic for my fiancé and i.  you don't often find people who pay attention to detail and really care about you.  just book them and see!

16684,36788,2010-04-20,70826,Jenn,"what a fantastic couple and a fantastic place to stay in dc. matt and jean were very gracious about letting us store our bags upstairs in their home when our red-eye arrived before the previous guests had left. 

while we didn't see them much (i believe jean was out of town and we were out exploring for most of the days), their hospitality was apparent throughout the apartment. the space was beautifully furnished and immaculately clean. it is also in a perfect location--a stones throw from union station and near all of the dc sites.

16684,41332,2010-05-10,71599,Colin,"jean's and matt's basement apartment was very comfortable, well-furnished and clean, with ample provisions for breakfasts for the six days we stayed. the wireless internet access worked well and we had ready access to the washer and dryer. it was mother's day during our stay and, at the request of my daughter in australia, jean very kindly delivered champagne and chocolates to our door. other nice touches were the toiletries in the bathroom and the tourist information.

16684,53588,2010-06-16,70166,Eleanor,"this is a brilliant apartment recommended to anyone. in fact i would happily live in it - it is a beautifully done out studio with a very comfy bed, a sofa/tv area, great bathroom and well equipped kitchen and there's even use of a backyard. it is literally two mins walk from union station and ten mins walk from the capitol and one evening we walked five mins in the other direction and found loads of nice restaurants (including a yummy mexican we ate in). there is even quiet air conditioning which just about made the washington humidity bearable. even better were the amazing small touches jean and matt laid on - fruit, cereal, bagels, yoghurt and juice which saw us through all our snacks and breakfasts for our four nights, small sachets of toileteries in the bathroom and leaflets and a guidebook too. also wifi and use of a washing machine. there is genuinely nothing they could do to make this nicer and i will recommend to any friend visiting dc. 

only thing is if you have trouble with stairs or a disability then this may not be great for you as the stairs down to the studio are very steep.

hi jean and matt, 

thank you so much for opening your home through airbnb.com. my husband michael and i had a wonderful time in dc thanks in part to your comfortable and welcoming guest suite. the suite was spacious and comfortable. it was wonderful to return to after a long day of sightseeing. the location was great, we couldn’t have found a better place just 2 blocks from union station. we would walk up to the station each morning to start our day. the station was an excellent starting and ending place each day with their many shops and eateries. we could pick up a tour, a taxi or the metro from there and get anywhere in the city very easily. thank you for the juices, water, fruit, yogurt, breakfast cereals and other goodies along with the treasure chest of maps, information pamphlets and brochures. we plan to visit dc again soon and hope that we will be fortunate enough to stay in your guest suite again.

16684,96639,2010-09-14,144515,Bet,"a sweet little apt in the capitol hill area that is close to everything visitors want to see.  if it isn't close, the metro or the local bus lines are all within walking distance through a renovated area with 100+ yrs old lovely row houses.  the apt was clean, quiet and comfortable. we did run out of trash bags but  happened to have some with us and used them to replace the filled ones.  if we had a complaint (which we really don't), it would be that we didn't know where to put the trash after we filled a bag.  however, that was not a problem until the day we left.  note: when others say that the entry steps are narrow and steep, they are truly warning those that have bad knees or trouble with steps.  these are not steps that you would want to travel several times daily.  all in all, we would definitely stay here again should we go back to dc.

16684,130166,2010-10-31,83445,Eleanor,"wow - wow -my husband and i took a trip to dc for our
50th wedding anniversary trip.  we have been to dc two other times, but we were in our rv.   this time we wanted to experience what living in dc is like.  

i am 70+ with fibromyalgia.  i require a very good bed and believe me - they provide a wonderful bed, and i slept like a baby.  

they pay attention to every detail,from providing great breakfast foods and snacks to the maps of district tours to historic sites to the access to washer and dryer, which allowed us to bring along fewer clothes.  and our room was 100 times cleaner than any hotel we have ever stayed in.  

a major advantage was the location.  we were just two blocks from union stdation where you can get any type of transportation you want as well as a wide choice in restaurants.  and we walked the six blocks to the capitol for our scheduled tour.

jean and matt were so helpful in anything we needed.  you will never find sweeter people to meet all your needs.  we highly recommend their place to any couple visiting the capitol.

i have already shared the information about the guest suite with some friends that have family in the dc area, and are looking for options other than typical hotels."

16684,271539,2011-05-20,263799,Lisa,"this was our first airbnb experience and it was great! the apartment , only two blocks from union station and within walking distance to capitol hill, national mall and the museums, was exactly as it is in the photos so there was no disappointment. the few steps down to the entry are very steep and tight so they need to be negotiated carefully. jean and matt are extremely friendly and helpful people who take a genuine interest in your holiday. they provide generous breakfast provisions and the little touches of fruit,  yogurt, juices, chocolates and toiletries were really appreciated. the welcome note with information and an array of brochures was very helpful. the bed was comfortable and the sheets and bath towels were so soft! laundry facilities are excellent and the wi fi reception was very good. we would highly recommend staying at jean's capitol hill guest suite and would love to stay there again. thank you jean and matt for your excellent hospitality! lisa and anthony. melbourne. australia."
16684,287176,2011-05-30,178404,Margaret,"i can't imagine a better place to stay in washington dc. it's a great location by the capitol and union station, yet quiet so you can get a good night's sleep. better than a hotel - no noisy lobbies and thin walls - and oodles more space. jean and matt left much more breakfast and tea/coffee provisions than i needed, so no going hungry in the morning. having access to a washer and dryer was such a bonus. and you might laugh but when you're travelling for several weeks some things things become more important than usual: here there is decent toilet paper, not sand paper! thank you! :-)
if jean & matt have a vacancy when you're visiting dc, you'd be mad not to snap it up."

16684,489601,2011-08-31,483260,Gregg,"you could not ask for a better place to stay when visiting washington, d.c. than matt & jean's, "" capitol suite."" the location is perfect, within walking distance  the u. s. capitol, supreme court, library of congress, etc. when you do need to use the metro, nearby union station offers access to all major points of the city. .with such a central location, my family & i were able to navigate our way around with ease. 

side note: one evening we decided to stay in the neighborhood after a whirlwind day of sightseeing. we were pleasantly surprised over the variety & number of neighborhood eateries, all reasonably priced and family friendly.the neighborhood itself is wonderful to walk or bike through

lastly, matt & jean were such great hosts. they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable & to attend to our needs. they're both easy going, warm and extremely friendly people. i hope the next time we visit dc, their lovely home is available."

the studio is about a 5 minute walk from the union station metro, so it's very convenient.

keyless entry 
super clean 
super organized 
treats!
great location - union station right next door
great neighborhood
the nicely written 1 pager into 
the dc map

for the bikers: bikeshare station is a minut walk away! very easy to explore the city like that!

to be short: everything said below is right! if you stay here, you'll be very happy!"
16684,3228178,2013-01-02,1337695,Jason,"the pictures reflect exactly how this wonderful basement level guest suite looks, both stylish and comfortable.  matt and jean were definitely purveyors of the hospitality trade in former lives.  as we entered we heard a soft murmuring and jean or matt had left on what sounded like running water via a sound system near the bed with other settings for a fire and so forth.  there were also accoutrements available for breakfast during our stay, such as a gallon of orange juice and milk, bread, and different spreads.  we had a technical glitch with the internet, but matt who was very responsive and right on the case.  he fixed it the next day alerting us through text what was happening, and said he would refund us our first night stay due to the inconvenience.  this is superb!  the fireplace was a real joy, we used it every night, and it really sets this place off.  we would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat.  very close and convenient to union station less than two blocks away, and public transit with a metro stop under union station.  absolutely no complaints."

16684,3506893,2013-02-10,4341846,Kathleen,"i wholeheartedly recommend you stay at jean and matt’s apartment. this is the first time we used airbnb and we were not disappointed. we stayed 6 days for a vacation in early february. the location is extremely convenient for any form of travel throughout the city and is a very safe neighborhood. even the neighbors and workers at local restaurants recognized and greeted us as we were out. it seems that everyone in the area is exceptionally friendly and considerate. jean and matt were quick to respond to inquiries via airbnb, e-mail, or telephone and were articulate and personable throughout the entire process. there were no issues or problems to report.

with respect to the apartment itself, it is tastefully and unobtrusively decorated. there are multiple seating areas for reading, dining or work. the apartment functioned for everything from our superbowl celebration to a romantic evening in. there were already organic and healthy snacks waiting for us, in addition to all of the other refinements throughout the space which other guests have already commented on. our family was very impressed with the nuance the space had, and how exceptionally clean and tailored it was for our visit.

take note of the exceptional feedback they have received as hosts, it is well-deserved.  if you are considering staying in washington d.c., i enthusiastically recommend you stay with jean and matt. i guarantee it will be a positive experience, and you will be planning future visits with them before you have even left.

16684,3788892,2013-03-15,4993030,Lowell,"location great.
we are from florida and no matter how high we put the thermo,  the temp never rose above 72 degrees. the floors were ice cold. there was really no place to dine except at the couch and the narrow (about 12"" wide) table in front of couch.
         the only area with sufficient lighting for reading was in bed. the bed was comfortable enough but no headboard. i am sorry we seem to be the only couple with criticisms but i call it as i see it.
it is what we call back home a polish flat, half under and half above ground.

16684,3853681,2013-03-21,857335,Michael,"i would definitely recommend matt and jean's capitol hill guest suite.  the accommodations were clean and comfortable, the location was awesome if your walking to the capitol and if you need to take the metro it is just two blocks away.  being from seattle i definitely need my coffee but starbucks i am afraid will not do so i was overjoyed to see the college type of coffe shop right on the corner of the street.  i had a wonderful stay and really appreciated the privacy and the prompt response to my emailed questions.

16684,3922222,2013-03-27,5412591,Danielle,"matt and jean's place is absolutely perfect. my partner and i were in town for the marriage equality rally, and the location to the supreme court couldn't have been more convenient.  the metro was right up the road, and ebeneezer's makes a mean dirty vanilla chai.  the apartment was extremely clean, comfortable, and it was just like staying in a nice hotel but with much more character and amenities.  the decor is absolutely calming, and the little touches like are perfect: a bottle of wine, breakfast items, dark chocolate, and the white noise machine they turn on to play ocean sounds for your arrival. they even leave a few logs in the fire place with a starter block and lighter.  i would absolutely recommend staying here, it has so much more character than a hotel, and is much more economical.  thank you guys!

16684,4076196,2013-04-08,5147728,Mary-Beth,"capitol hill guest suites was the perfect place for my friend and i to stay while visiting dc for a friend's wedding! it was clean, inviting, easy to get to, close to the metro at union station, and easy to walk to the mall/museum's.  the bed was super comfortable and the fireplace made it so cozy.

there was a little kitchen and it was stocked with just the right things to get us going: yogurt, milk, bread, jam, oj and thank goodness- coffee!

i highly recommend capital hill guest suites and if i were to have any hesitation in doing so, it's only because i want to go back and not have it booked by someone else when i do!

thank you matt and jean for a wonderful visit to dc!"
16684,4116100,2013-04-11,4741601,Bram,"this was our second airbnb reservation and again it was a very positive one. matt & jean have really gone overboard, their suite is even better than most hotel rooms/suites. you immediately feel relaxed, at ease when you enter the main room. the keycode door is easy, there was some fresh fruit, chocolates, a bottle of wine. a lot of welcoming details.
the place is very clean and full of nice surprises. the location is also the best, just around the corner of union station, a great italian place on one corner of the street and a good coffee bar at the other side of the street. there's a rental bike station just a few steps away and we would advize anyone fit enough to use this formula. the weather was great and we drove to all monuments, memorials, georgetown, u-street,... we only used a taxi to get back to the airport.
we met matt, he was a very nice person and gave us some helpful tips. all communication was very easy and timely answered.
most topics have already been described in other reviews and we can only confirm all the positive feedback is well-deserved.
this place comes highly recommended!"
16684,4212826,2013-04-19,5298629,Judith,very comfortable basement apartment with everything we needed. internet worked very well. it was really nice to find some breakfast foods already in the kitchen and the fresh bread was particularly welcome. the flat was quiet though we still enjoyed the white noise radio which was provided. an excellent location. matt and jean were really helpful and provided a small dining table which made it much easier for eating meals. they also answered any enquiry very quickly. we would have liked to have stayed longer but they were fully booked. thoroughly recommend to anyone staying in washington dc.

the apartment was very nicely furnished, the bathroom has inspired my future plans for my own bathroom, the bed was extremely comfortable and almost impossible to get out of and the breakfast supplies were an awesome touch!
the apartment is in a very convenient location for any tourist activities, in a quiet area, very close to the station and comfortable walking distance to many of the sites.
matt and jean responded super quickly to any of our questions and were fairly flexible and helpful regarding our check in/out times.
i can't recommend this place highly enough! thanks again!

it is very modern after its renovation but you still think you are living in history - it is also spotlessly clean and the pictures don't do it justice!

it was just great to come home to after a long day sight seeing to just relax in this apartment 

thanks matt and jean we had an amazing week!"

we would definitely book again !

16684,7503033,2013-09-23,6220023,Skye,"this was the first place we stayed on air bnb and we weren't disappointed! the suite is just like the pictures - very neat and well decorated. it is close to union station and easily accessible from the street. the kitchen was well stocked with breakfast items that satisfied us throughout our stay, along with wine and chocolates (a very nice touch). the kitchen is well equipped too!  there is also shampoo, conditioner, and soap provided along with towels for your stay. matt and jean were very helpful in terms of leaving maps, brochures etc and answering all of our questions. we didn't have any issues with street noise however we could hear whenever the hosts entertained. that being said, it wasn't often and is to be expected when you are staying in someone's basement. the suite is in close proximity to a few restaurants, a coffee shop and a supermarket and is within walking distance to the mall. we would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to washington dc! we had a great time in the city and it was made all the better being able to come home after a long day to the capitol hill guest suite. thank you matt and jean! "
16684,7639114,2013-09-28,5170025,Sarah,"from the minute we stepped in the front door, we knew that we had found a great place to stay. the place was clean, spacious, tastefully decorated, conveniently located and well-stocked with supplies to keep us comfortable. here's what we loved specifically:
- easy key exchange. jean sent us a code for the front door so we didn't need to make arrangements to meet up;
- close to union station. it was only a 500metre walk (or thereabouts)
- jean had stocked the apartment with breakfast items, wine, snacks, maps, soaps, ...everything we needed;
- the bed was super comfortable, shower was good, tv had all the channels;
- there was a noise machine left for us to use but we found that it wasn't necessary as the street was not overly busy.
both jean and matt were welcoming and friendly people and their little place in capitol hill was one of the many reasons we have fallen in love with washington dc.
we hope we can come back one day and we would definitely recommend this little gem to others."
16684,7894248,2013-10-07,503056,Colleen,"matt and jean definitely go with extra mile to make their guests feel special! there was breakfast food, milk, oj, tea/coffee stocked in the kitchen which i was a fantastic surprise! i didn't hear any noise from the outside, and i also loved they there was a private entrance to come and go as you please. the room was clean, stylish, and exactly what i was looking for. thanks matt and jean for a great stay!

17131,31242,2010-03-24,95598,Laura,"a last minute business trip to washington, dc and no reasonable hotel rooms led me to airbnb and teresa.  what a find! teresa was so gracious and accommodating.  she made me tea in the evening and dropped me at the metro in the morning.  the loft was neat and tidy and furnished with lovely down pillows.  if you are traveling to washington and need a place to stay, i highly recommend teresa!"
17131,40674,2010-05-07,2581889,Ugnius,"i urgently needed a place to stay, and teresa kindly responded to my last minute call with the offer to stay at the loft. their house is nothing short of amazing - very clean and comfortable with a twist of historic charm to it. 
they are very kind and accommodating hosts, and good conversationalists. i wasn't sure, if i will need an extra night at their house or not, so teresa agreed to accommodate me on a mattress, in case she is out of rooms that night, and i need to stay. fortunately, this was not needed, but i greatly appreciated her flexibility."
17131,850617,2012-01-08,20938,Marcus,"these guys are awesome people, and their place is convenient, quiet, and comfortable.   i've stayed with them twice ( july 2009 & january 2012), and i'd recommend them to anyone.  you;d be hard pressed to find a more satisfying air b n b experience.  "
17131,967608,2012-03-03,465216,Iris,"we went to g-town for visiting friends and sightseeing. i got this website and the house information based on browsing internet randomly, and then i  went over all the ratings and review, i made up my mid to choose their hosue. it was such a great experience in my life so far in states. 
the hosts are really nice and patient to us, they know everything really well around d.c., give you best information and recommendation for eating and sightseeing place. all of us were very satisfied with this short t trip, we should have spend more days in d.c. but our spring breaks ended so quickly and we gotta back to our school..... "
17131,1014129,2012-03-18,1647947,Olena,"staying at teresa's ""loft near national cathedral"" was a great experience. the loft is spacious, the hosts are welcoming (we had great dinners together), the house location is superb just short few minutes via public transportation to george town, downtown, dupont circle, dca airport.  "
17131,1131055,2012-04-15,1743525,Pietro Daniel,"i had a wonderful month in washington, dc thanks to teresa’s and her family’s hospitality! it is definitively the place i would like to stay next time that i’ll come and visit the capital. it is a quiet and well-located place, and also ideal for meeting nice people, having good conversations and fun."
17131,3404208,2013-01-23,480758,Navid,i had an incredible stay for three nights at the loft in teresa and reid's home. the room was perfect in every way and the neighborhood is really gorgeous and peaceful. teresa and reid were absolutely delightful. i happened to be visiting dc during reid's birthday and they were so kind to invite me to take part in the little celebration with them. would love to stay with them again on future visits.
17131,3726116,2013-03-08,3502637,Kateri,"the space is cute and comfortable, and the hosts very welcoming and nice.  it is close to bus lines, but a little far from the metro. it is in a very pleasant neighborhood. "
17131,3810163,2013-03-17,5068859,Susan,"my stay at the loft was great.  i was in town for a short-term internship in bethesda and was staying in shaky situation and ""transitioning"" part of dc for my first week, so i needed to find a  quick place to stay for my second week that was clean, warm, and in a safe neighborhood.  this was my first time using airbnb for accommodations so i was pretty picky.  the loft is part of a great family home in the cathedral heights neighborhood which is safe, beautiful, and convenient to many metrobus lines.  there is a starbucks, whole foods, chipotle, panera, and other convenient food options as well as a connect to the red line just a  short bus ride north to tenleytown.  and there are other food options and small local markets a short 10 minute walk downhill to glover park.  getting around was very easy and i felt very comfortable walking around the area by myself at night.
the loft is screened off with a large shoji screen from the guest that is staying in the bedroom on third floor, which may stretch the limits of privacy for some people, but it was not a problem for me.  the gentleman staying there was very respectful.  the house is a classic, older, dc home with creaky wood floors and thin walls so if the regular sounds of people coming and going will bother you, then maybe you should seek a more modern dwelling.  this is a real home that is lived in by a real family and i had nothing but positive experiences there.
teresa and reid were incredibly nice and their 16 year old son, ian, was quiet and respectful as well.  they have two cute cats who you may never see and that they don't allow in the loft area for guest comfort and so the cats don't get trapped on the third floor without food or access to the litter box.  there are always neighbors and friends stopping by and several long-term renters in some of the rooms.  they are warm and welcoming to stay with and i would not hesitate to stay with them again.  teresa even gave me a ride to the red line metro on my last day because i was juggling all my luggage and the sky was threatening rain.  truly nice people, you can't go wrong staying here. "
17131,3857590,2013-03-21,95294,Bryan,"teresa and reid were fantastic hosts to my mother! i booked the space and they were tremendously kind and accommodating. the loft room was cozy, had a great  bed and was very quiet. we also had a key snafu and teresa was very helpful.
i would highly recommend staying with reid and teresa any time!"
17131,3933472,2013-03-28,3236902,Vilius,"teresa and her husband were very welcoming, and they were also  great to talk to. my room was perfect for what i needed, great location, almost centrally situated. i would definitely rent with teresa again.

20067,35022,2010-04-11,104618,Rob,"my stay at marie's home was wonderful.  i stayed in a private room with its own bathroom ensuite.  marie's house is located in a very beautiful and desirable part of the city (the vice-presidents official residence is basically behind her house!) and in walking distance to adam's morgan, the national cathedral, georgetown, and many other great areas.  marie was the perfect host and ensured that i was comfortable during my entire stay.  (marie: thanks for taking me out to a blues bar, in addition to lending me a sweater!)"

20067,122624,2010-10-19,234460,Rob,my own pied-a-terre in the heart of embassy row!  a quiet suburban oasis just ten minutes from bustling dupont circle.  the sheltered and seated massachusetts avenue bus stop is just a 30 second walk away.  two other bus routes are nearby as well.  marie-louise is a gracious bon vivant who made me feel welcome.

neighborhood is upscale, the vice-president's mansion is over the back fence, though the secret service discourages dropping by for a chat in his kitchen. 

parking for one car. 15 min. walk to metro. 5 min. by bike to rock creek park path. excellent close-in and inexpensive base from which to see the city by bicycle.

hostess is bright and happy, contributing to the pleasant surroundings."
20067,250310,2011-05-03,510519,Paul,"marie and her mother are lovely hosts, providing information when asked for but otherwise both are very quiet.

20067,1296071,2012-05-17,135414,Junko,"i had a most fulfilling experience at marie’s house. a private room with bathroom and a separate entrance were all helpful since my trip involved some work as a journalist. the room was clean, practical with an aura of culture and intelligence (which was quite conducive to my own writing!). maria is smart, genuine, flexible and very easy to talk to. i also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood, not only embassy row right around the corner but also the quaint residential streets with many old, well-managed houses of their own charm and personality. it was a very convenient location to get to downtown, either by bus or taxi. i would highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a quality stay. thank you so much again for everything, marie!"

a 10 minute walk to the south west brings one to an area where restaurants and whole foods are located on wisconsin.  if you want a coffee in the morning you have to walk up to starbucks or the bagel shop.

a half hour walk brings you to foggy bottom and georgetown down wisconsin ave."

20067,1933090,2012-08-09,105831,Tessa,"an excruciatingly uncomfortable bed.  a house far from shops.  a room full of old magazines, where the lights, the door, the windows, did not work correctly and needed repair. no facilities, i rented the unrapaired storage room and had to fit myself in."
20067,2073688,2012-08-23,2971532,Shiela,"beware! this place has a severe bedbug infestation. i came away with bites and itching over much of my body and with my clothes and luggage infested with the beasts. i showed the blots on the mattress (no mattress cover) and photos of my bites to the owner (and pointed out a 5 inch worm like creature in the bathroom). she seemed a bit flummoxed by the whole affair and offered to refund the unused portion of my payment. i bagged all of my clothes in plastic, made an emergency hair appointment to get the creatures out of my scalp and beat a hasty retreat to a hotel. now at home and trying to fumigate, wash, and dry clean all affected items and get a dermatologist to look at my still itching skin, including private parts, i am frantic that despite my measures some live creatures have made it into my own home. in response to a follow up e mail, the owner now is now in complete denial and refuses any further refund or compensation for my emergency expenses. 
	although in a nice upscale neighborhood, the room itself is essentially a storage area with a sofa bed and almost all closet and desk space, and a good chunk of floor space taken up with the owners personal items. as far as the rapturous visitor reviews (except the most recent one) currently posted on her site, my guess is that someone has learned how to really game the review system.

22453,201790,2011-03-17,416839,Diane,"i was curious to try airbnb, and melissa's loft share what  my first venture. it was easy, comfortable, well located and best of all - two gorgeous cats to keep me company! and she's got a fabulous bathroom - all which was very clean! i had to leave early in the morning so i didn't really meet melissa, but i look forward to it next time. i did get a little chilly at night and she turned the heat up for me - thank you melissa.!"
22453,204069,2011-03-20,409820,Vladimir,"melissa is a kind and gnerous host.
her apartament has a very comfortable location, within five minutes walk from the local entertainments. inside you can find everything you may need, includig 2 adorable cats. the sofa is also very comfortable.
i'd recommend melissa's apartament to anybody going to dc both for business or for pleasure."
22453,227276,2011-04-15,457162,Jessica,great place! melissa was always willing to help give directions or suggestions around dc.  i would stay there again.  love the cats!
22453,246095,2011-05-01,254258,Amit,"m's place is perfect! clean, warm, and comfortable. location is wonderful and the host, melissa, is charming and considerate. will definitely stay there anytime i am in dc. "
22453,253423,2011-05-06,457162,Jessica,"gorgeous, warm apartment in a great neighborhood.  i wish i could live there!  lots of places to eat on 17th and 14th street.  melissa was great again!"
22453,261171,2011-05-12,547867,John,"melissa was a great host, i felt welcomed and would enjoy staying there again for any dc visit.. also nice is that its walking distance to the center of the town."
22453,296145,2011-06-03,457162,Jessica,"i had another great time with melissa this past week.  she is a great host and her place is in a very ""happening"" part of town.  "

22453,308817,2011-06-11,144877,Tamara,"melissa's loft apartment is as lovely as it appears in the listing and is very conveniently located to the dupont circle metro as well as a zipcar pod across the street (if that's relevant to you-- it was for me since i had an early morning meeting in the suburbs away from the metro line). although melissa and i saw each other very briefly as i was leaving in the morning, she was accommodating in that she arranged for me to pick up the keys because she was out when i was scheduled to arrive. if i need to be in dc again for business i would definitely consider staying at melissa's."
22453,321277,2011-06-18,179364,Stephanie,excellent host!  great location...very comfortable and enjoyed my stay!  melissa is awesome...loved chatting and networking!
22453,329389,2011-06-22,716033,Catriona,melissa was very accommodating as i needed somewhere at very short notice.  she has a very lovely apartment and was an interesting person to talk to.  i enjoyed my brief stay!
22453,332061,2011-06-24,280166,Rand,"the loft was fantastic, very nicely decorated and much larger than it looks in the pictures. i stayed on the sofa bed in the living room, and melissa's den and sleeping loft is way in the back so there was more privacy than one would expect. melissa was very welcoming though we hardly crossed paths as she and i were both busy and away from the condo much of the time. also, its in a great neighborhood, close to whole foods, lavida gym, good eateries and local nightlife.

i'd definitely stay here again when visiting dc."
22453,925373,2012-02-16,1597781,Julia,"melissa was a fabulous host! beautiful apartment with everything you need, and great location for getting around. melissa was very welcoming and gave great tips on dc, i thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would love to return. "
22453,979439,2012-03-07,1392063,Chuck,"modern condo space, with elegant remodel and furnishings, on quiet one-way street. melissa was a great host."
22453,1010038,2012-03-17,1899641,Ali,"what a friendly, welcoming host and a great, central place to stay in the city. it is possible to walk to the white house and the nearest metro is less than 10 minutes walk away at dupont circle. the neighbourhood is great for eating out at night with a relaxed, safe feel. melissa was keen to help with any information and happy to chat, but she also allowed me a sense of privacy and made me feel i could relax quietly in her beautiful apartment. the cats are adorable. thank you melissa for a 5* welcome."
22453,1029014,2012-03-21,1723850,Quynh,"i wish i could have met melissa and take in more of her beautiful loft in the daylight, but i was in late and out before the sun rose the next morning and we never crossed paths. her kittens were there to keep me company though and melissa was very responsive via text. everything was perfect!"
22453,1055949,2012-03-28,1389103,Clémence,"melissa is the perfect host: open to discussion, able to give great advice about washington but also able to leave some privacy. the place is very nice and the bathroom is huge!!!!"
22453,1060758,2012-03-30,621241,Brandon,"melissa's place is beautiful, and she is so friendly and welcoming.  i had to get up at the crack of dawn to get to dulles, and my phone alarm clock wasn't working.  even after a long day of work, melissa set an alarm for me and i made my bus.  i owe it all to her.  this place is great."
22453,1069305,2012-04-01,1917131,Steve,"this was my first experience with airbnb, and it was everything i hoped it would be and more! the logan circle elegant loft share was exacly what i was looking for. the hostess, melissa, was exceptionally supportive to my unusual check-in / check-out times as well as ensuring i had a restful, quiet, safe and clean place to stay.  "
22453,1156250,2012-04-20,2011592,Meng,the location of the flat is great as it is very close to dupont circle. i had a very comfortable stay with melissa for 2 days. thank you very much melissa!
22453,1171642,2012-04-23,1108899,Sheetal,"melissa's loft is exactly as it looks in the pictures and she is a very thoughtful host who went out of her way to accommodate my travel schedule and  make sure that i had everything i needed once there. i loved the leafy neighborhood with it's lively street life, the many restaurants and the easy walk to the metro at dupont circle."
22453,1182743,2012-04-25,52746,Sol,this was my first experience at airbnb and it completely fullfulled my expectations. thanks to melissa my one night stay at washington was amazing! she was really helpfull and friendly. her place is amazing! thanks melissa!

22453,1358487,2012-05-27,645007,I&I,"melissa was a great host!
the place is very well located, clean and comfortable.
i arrived there around 11pm and melissa was very kind to cook for me some typical food from puerto rico.
i strongly recommend to stay at her place."
22453,1433742,2012-06-07,2383462,Becks,i enjoyed my stay in melissa's loft. melissa was extremely accommodating and helpful about the area. she's a wonderful host! her expertise of the area  and kindness heightened my experience in d.c. and i would recommend her place to anyone. 
22453,1446867,2012-06-09,1482164,Barry,"melissa is a hero! she responded promptly to my fairly last-minute request for accomodation, quickly responded to my various special requests... and she's a lovely, friendly, interesting lady.
and her apartment is gorgeous; stylish, immaculate, comfortable, cool location... all 5-star.  melissa even drove me to the metro station when i left to help me with my giant heavy suitcase.  
i highly recommend melissa and certainly hope to stay at her place next time i'm in dc. cheers, barry
:-)

22453,1470972,2012-06-12,2371866,Michiel,my first trip to dc was extra good because of m's place. her place is gorgeous - the pictures really don't lie - and the location is great: quiet street but  every time.
22453,1485630,2012-06-15,2220881,Clayton,"melissa was simply a joy to stay with. she took the time to show me around the neighborhood despite having to get ready for an appointment that morning. after the long day i had with my business in town, it was nice to come home to someone who offers you a decent cup of tea. will most definitely be recommending her to family and friends in the future.

22453,1533191,2012-06-21,2004651,Josh,"melissa is a wonderful host.  she suggested great restaurants near by.  she also went out of her way to make sure my stay was comfortable.  great place, great host."
22453,1536421,2012-06-22,95741,Gia,melissa was a wonderful host and her place is lovely!
22453,1543648,2012-06-23,346766,Mary,"melissa has a gorgeous open-plan apartment that is a 10-minute walk from dupont circle.  though it is open-plan, there is a partial wall between the living room/guest area and her bedroom, created privacy and comfort.  highly recommended!"
22453,1753259,2012-07-20,2480104,Isabelle,"melissa's place was exactly as described on the website.  unfortunately, i barely saw her during my stay in washington, d.c.  and we did not talk much.  it was my first bnb experience and i will recommend it to anyone (and have already done so)."
22453,1878253,2012-08-03,2926603,Liliana,"this is a great place to stay.  the apartment is close to tons of restaurants and bars.  also right next to a bikeshare which is a great way to get around dc.  i took the sofa bed option which was fine.  the kitties even slept with me some of the time:)  melissa's apartment looks just like the pictures so you don't arrive saying ""this looks nothing like the pics.""  great place for the price.  would definitely return.
"
22453,1932433,2012-08-09,2769714,David,"the location was good, but if you are looking for a good nights sleep there were some issues. 1) the pull out bed is old and the mattress needs to be replaced, 2) the street light is bright and keeps the lounge area well lit at night, and finally 3) the upstairs neighbour has a dog that you can hear running during the night.
i had no issues with melissa. she was a good host.
"
22453,2068067,2012-08-22,1597231,Filippo,"absolutely a fantastic experience! as the loft was busy the day of my reservation, she hosted me in her entire flat in dc in exchange, with no extra charges! was an amazing place, with a view over the city and in a beautiful location.
next time i'll be in dc i'll contact her for sure!"
22453,2104701,2012-08-26,3196519,Jacie,i stayed with melissa on and off for two weeks as my first airbnb experience and everything was great. she was a fantastic host and she has an amazing apartment and location - will definitely be in touch on my next trip!
22453,2241715,2012-09-09,55021,Sascha,"melissa's place is great. clean, tastefully decorated and comfortable. she wasn't in washington during my visit but she was in touch and made sure that i had everything i needed."
22453,2526431,2012-10-06,1910519,Brendan,melissa was a great host. place was very conveniently located too.
22453,2582999,2012-10-11,167996,Kristin,"this was my first visit to dc, and melissa provided the perfect place to stay.  the location is great, place is beautiful, and melissa was a friendly and wonderful host.  i enjoyed our chats, she made me tea one morning, let me borrow an umbrella in case it rained, and had some really great restaurant suggestions.  not sure what else to say, but i will try to stay with melissa again the next time i come back to dc!!"
22453,2891866,2012-11-15,361449,Jennifer H.,melissa was very welcoming and flexible (especially with my late night arrival due to a weather delay).   the apartment is nice and in a great location.  
22453,3042211,2012-12-08,4067549,Mercedes,melissa established early contact with me to ensure i knew how to get to her place. she offered great advice about what to do in dc and really made me feel right at home. i would strongly recommend her as a host.
22453,3367924,2013-01-18,811169,Issa,"why wouldn't you want to stay with melissa and her two cats in her amazing place? why wouldn't you want to experience what it's like to take a shower in a cathedral, cleansing water pouring in from the heavens? why wouldn't you want to enjoy great conversation about her crazy job? why wouldn't you want to be walking distance from a million things to do, and all the important-looking buildings in washington? i don't know, but i got home after staying with melissa and upon stepping into the shower thought to myself, ""well, this is a downgrade."""
22453,3660765,2013-03-01,4827907,Thiago,"melissa is a great host, she is kindly and explain to me the best place to visit in dc. her apartment is cozy and nice to stay, her  cats don't border nobody and bathroom is really nice.
 "
22453,3774688,2013-03-13,3752324,Erin,melissa's home was really clean and beautiful. felt very comfortable there!
22453,3991660,2013-04-01,5222462,Peter,the only thing i didn't like about my stay with melissa was that i didn't spend enough days at her place! she is an amazing host and the apartment is really clean and wonderfully designed. she has made a booklet for guests with places to go to and things to see and you can always ask her for further recommendations... this is how airbnb is supposed to work! she even drove me to the airport! thanks melissa for the wonderful time and i will definitely come back!!!
22453,4112443,2013-04-10,2809091,Anne,melissa has a very beautiful apartment and two adorable cats.  i was in town for a brief conference nearby and really enjoyed my stay at her place.  i highly recommend her apartment and she is a gracious host. 
22453,4130722,2013-04-12,95741,Gia,"melissa is a wonderful host! easy to communicate with, her place is lovely, as is she!"
22453,4216141,2013-04-19,5740790,Federico Lorenzo,"the apartment was really clean and comfortable, and melissa a wonderful host. my trip to washington was absolutely awesome, though very short, and the location plus the near metro station and services available in the area made it really good!"
22453,4753627,2013-05-23,5628274,Pamela,"a fascinating, flexible and friendly host.  the apartment is bigger than it appears and beautifully decorated.  "
22453,4766685,2013-05-24,2654363,Lana,"awesome stay :) i arrived a little later than we agreed, but melissa was totally fine with it! her place is awesome! it is just beautiful! and the bathroom is amazing too. she was so kind- i could use the bathroom at any time. she made my night in dc just amazing. totally would love to come there again! "
22453,5285870,2013-06-22,6920580,Jane Marie,"my accommodations with melissa were outstanding: one of the highlights of my dc visit. inside plusses include: wifi; long bathroom vanity counter with separate sinks for host and guest; room in the fridge for my groceries; neat, clean, and stylish appointments; a binder of dc visitor brochures & maps; a very sweet grey resident kitty cat. outside plusses include: a whole foods store just 1 ½ blocks away; circulator bus just 1 ½ blocks away (seniors pay 50 cents); quiet narrow street in a neighborhood of churches, embassies, and beautiful, grand residential architecture. as a photographer of architectural detail, i spent hours walking and clicking within a few block radius and the 6 block walk to the phillips collection (diebenkorn! matisse! degas! a closet lined in beeswax!) was like heaven. although the loft has a mostly open floor plan, melissa and kitty cat provided me privacy and company in good proportion. both showed excellent character."
22453,5742394,2013-07-14,4694399,Leif,"convenient location. melissa's unit is clean and modern inside, with a really efficient use of space. it feels airy and spacious. melissa keeps her home spotlessly clean, and she is very helpful with info about the neighborhood, transportation, places to eat, and places to see. there is wifi (very helpful). it's about four blocks to the nearest metro stop (dupont circle north), but only half a block to 16th st., where its easy to catch a cab. melissa herself is a bright, engaging person with a lot going on in her busy life. she is helpful when you need help, and will leave you alone when you want privacy. 

the bed was a sofa bed in the living space you see in the picture. not as comfortable as a regular bed, but certainly better than a futon. worked fine for me. 

btw, i had to get wrinkles out of my suit for a meeting. she had a steamer that did the trick. "
22453,5851218,2013-07-19,11795,Sol,melissa was a great host and had tons of info on dc available for guests. her apartment is amazing and much bigger than it looks in the photos. i have serious bathroom envy! i would highly recommend staying with melissa and her cat!
22453,6605824,2013-08-18,3190114,Gavin,melissa's apartment was perfect - very pleasant surroundings on a quiet residential street (very handy for the bike share station a block away). coordinating key pickup and access was easy and melissa was a great host - it was a shame our schedules didn't intersect a little more. i would gladly stay there again.  
24712,523173,2011-09-12,830510,Frank,"the house was exactly as it looked in the pictures--and although there were some minor plumbing issues the owner was prompt in fixing them the first day and was very attentive to any other issues that may have occurred. that was very much appreciated and is the main reason i would book with them again. 

the house has 3 comfortable bedrooms (each of which has a large flastscreen hdtv!), beautiful hardwood floors, and the first floor is spacious and open between the kitchen, and the living and dining rooms. all beds and couches were comfortable an the decor was warm and inviting--i felt right at home at the end of the first day!

can't wait to return the next time i'm in waahington, dc!"
24712,885285,2012-01-27,675208,Ben,"nice house, clean, nice neighborhood.  would stay here again."
24712,1301845,2012-05-19,1601841,Gerardo,"we found this residence to be just as it was described. it was very comfortable, clean, and set in a quiet neighborhood. we arrived when the cleaning crew was still cleaning. each crew member made sure we were happy with the condition of the residence, they were helpful in showing us the house, and each provided very helpful information related to sight seeing and transportation. each time we needed to speak to the homeowner, he was readily available, courteous, and informative. i would definitely recommend this place for your stay. "
24712,1371919,2012-05-29,1558237,Huseyin,"this is a lovely house with lots of space for a large group of travellers. it's clean, with a large kitchen and plenty of bathrooms. there's a deck out the back and a porch in the front for you to enjoy. the ac works fine (but the fans make the basement a bit noisier than the rest of the house).

the house is in a relatively friendly neighbourhood, but as always with dc, stay safe and stay in a group if you're out at night. petworth used to have a bad reputation but it's steadily improving. it's 15 minutes walk to georgia ave metro (but i'd recommend using pre-booked taxis at night - dc taxis are very cheap and the drivers are friendly). there's space for 1 or 2 cars if you need to park nearby on the street.
"
24712,1947133,2012-08-11,2448284,Melissa,"we had a fabulous time in dc!  this house is pretty much as advertised: about 6/10ths of a mile from the metro (fairly easy walk, but we sometimes parked in the neighborhood closer).  we spent most of our time at the house gathered on main floor which was comfortable w/nice tv to watch the olympics:)  rooms a little stark, but again only slept here, so fine.  never could figure where the off-street parking was, but there were usually 2 spots available in front anyway.  owner was always very responsive to calls, e-mails, etc."
24712,2855991,2012-11-11,3748179,Rebecca,"this home was a great value for our large group in the dc area. we stayed three nights and were quite comfortable. the place was as it was described on the listing, and quite spacious with a nice kitchen. there is an alarm system for the place, so that made us feel secure when we were not there during the day. at first, figuring out the heating system was a bit finicky but when the owner called me back i had already figured it out. there were plenty of clean towels; i would say this: if you are picky about other people's bedding, bring your own. not all of the bedding provided here was something we wanted to use. the home is a little ways out of the center of town, so be prepared to walk about 15 minutes to the nearest metro station or have a vehicle with you. overall, i would recommend this place to others, especially with a large group. "
24712,2955651,2012-11-25,3411045,Douglas,"our family of 14 really enjoyed our stay over thanksgiving at this home.  it is a great house for multiple family arrangements.  it has nice baths, beautiful floors, great flat-screen t.v.'s, a well-positioned kitchen with updated appliances.  rooms are very adequate.  very little to complain about here.  walk to a metro is less than a mile through a residential area.  worked great to get down to the mall & memorials.  quiet neighborhood without any issues.  we enjoyed our stay!   thanks!!  the oakes family"
24712,3344897,2013-01-14,2290907,Mike,"my first experience with airbnb - and luckily, it turned out to be a good one :-)

i travelled with a group of three other colleagues who each needed a separate bedroom. this turned out to be a much cheaper option than four hotel rooms - and i dare say, a much better option too.

the house is extremely spacious. upper level has one master bedroom with direct access to its own bathroom, two minor (but still spacious) bedrooms which share the other bathroom on the upper level. then there's the living room and kitchen at the ground floor - and in the basement you have what's essentially an entire 'house' with its own bedroom, bathroom and living room. in addition to this, there's several beds / futtons. we were just four people - it could easily accomodate two families...

the house did show some wear (mostly in the basement), but nothing too major. one of my colleagues complained about stains on a duvet/quilt, but he found another which satisfied him. if you want to be sure, bring your own cover. i wouldn't say it's needed, though. in general, the house seemed clean, and personally i didn't find anything worth complaining about.

to sum up, everything is as described which is obviously a good thing.

neighbourhood seemed very safe, didn't encounter any issues. it takes 10-15 minutes to walk to the metro, but if you like, there's also a bus close by the house. at the metro, there's a few places to eat and a cvs where you can do the basic shopping.

metro is just two stops from u street where you can find lots of bars and restaurants, five stops from chinatown (more restaurants and verizon center) while the 'touristy' part of the city (the mall) is about 7 stops away. it's not a long ride, and the house seems to ideally placed.

about the host: we had some trouble figuring out the key lock upon arrival. we called the company at 6/7pm - call was immediately taken,  and we were guided through the process. spotless service :-)

didn't receive any 'surprise' bills after returning home, either. the price listed here at airbnb is the one we ended up paying. depositum has been returned, too.

so all in all, a very successful first experience with airbnb - especially thanks to ola / capital vacation."
24712,4562681,2013-05-13,4738017,Demi,my family and i really enjoyed our stay. we were in town for about 5 days to attend a spring graduation and this house was absolutely perfect. we had a group of 8 and there was more than enough space. the spacious and open layout was ideal for entertaining additional guests. the location was perfect for us because of the close proximity to the university campus and to a metro rail station with parking (fort totten). if we ever come back to the area this rental will definitely be at the top of our list.
24712,7368461,2013-09-17,7737634,Brendan,"place was great, and as advertised.  it was comfortable for all of those of us who came into town for the wedding.  very conveniently located.  i would do it again in a heartbeat.  "
24712,7626285,2013-09-27,8499795,Terry,"a nice, big space with all of the technology to keep everyone in the family happy.  flat screens in every room worked great. we felt safe and comfortable in the house.  parked two cars on the street out front easily each day. backyard area for this home is the nicest in a less than nice area, but we shut the door, drew the blinds and never looked back. 

we drove less than two miles and parked at the columbia heights metro in a garage for $12 each day. garage had a target with a grocery and several very nice dinner options after touring all day. easier than walking a mile with kids to the closer georgia avenue metro. "
24712,8018964,2013-10-13,7705756,Lindy,"my family of 6 stayed here for 4 nights. the house was moderately clean and had plenty of space.  however, about 2 days after arriving the roof started to leaking in the master bedroom and continued to get worst and worst even spreading to the bathroom and different parts of the bedroom. the owner was contacted and did nothing! noone came to try and fix the problem. only on our last night he offered for us to stay at another listing. at that point it was a little too late. also, the washer and dryer that was promised was broken and was a hazard as was the leak due to it pouring in from the light fixture. i understand things happen and houses have issues but my issue is with the owner who was very unprofessional and did not work to fix the problem or at least try and reimburse us for some of the cost. if it werent for the owner not caring about the house or about keeping his renters comfortable then i would recommend this home. with this current owner i strongly caution you about renting from him. i suggest trying another home for your vacation."
24712,8401386,2013-10-29,1382625,Mark,"it was ok, and did the trick.  the lighting is rather dull with several bulbs out throughout the house.  the dryer took nearly four hours to dry a single load, while one washer was out of operation. (there was a working one downstairs) we couldn't find the trash dumpsters assigned to the house outside.

the finished basement suite is a little creepy with low lighting and loud furnace noises.  the neighborhood is fine, and the distance to metro is not bad. we drove our car, and parked near train station. 

the owner was easily available, and gave us great instructions on how to access the property.

overall, it was fine for our needs. not luxurious by any means, but can accommodate a large group.

24712,8872676,2013-11-23,83190,Ed,we had a great stay at the location. the place was very clean and well kept.
26147,39620,2010-05-02,105607,Nilda,i had a good experience staying with val. the cozy twin bed was really cozy. i felt like being home. she was very nice. i would stay again but i recently moved just few blocks away!
26147,39902,2010-05-03,105607,Nilda,"i stayed for a second night because of my moving to dc. again, really cozy bed, spotless room. val was very friendly."
26147,41944,2010-05-12,118621,Kiley,"val is a very nice woman and an accommodating host. i stayed in the cozy twin bed room for two nights and was very happy that i rented from val. the bedroom was exactly as pictured. it had a tv, ceiling fan and large closet and dresser. val left clean towels out and bottled water and gave me the wireless internet access code. there were other guests staying at the house while i was there and they all seemed to be friendly, kind people. the house is located in a residential neighborhood a few miles away from the more touristy area of dc, but it is easily accessible by the bus line running 14th street. i will definitely stay here on my next visit to dc! thanks val :)"
26147,44386,2010-05-20,104426,Lilibeth,"val is a great host!  she made me feel welcome and the accommodation was exceptional.  i met her daughter cheryl who's not only pretty but graceful. val's home is close to downtown dc and through val's direction,i quickly learned to take the bus. i even invited her to visit me in california.  thanks val!"
26147,5044670,2013-06-09,6533552,Bongumusa,"i stayed at val's spacious accomodation for two nights, mainly was there for siteseeing. she was friendly, helpful and the overall experience was amazing. the house was clean and i was very comfortable. she offered comprehensive breakfast. definitely will recommend val's house to anybody visiting dc."
27281,51828,2010-06-11,16182,Kim,"we had a wonderful stay in dc thanks to stephen's cozy apartment. the place was just as described and more. it was a perfect place to return to after a long day of sight seeing. it was nice to come home and reenergize for the next day. stephen was the perfect host. like a fine waiter, he was there when we needed him or to offer bits of information but never obtrusive. great host & great apartment!"
27281,54376,2010-06-18,116720,Selena,"stephen and his wife have a wonderful place. my husband and i were so glad to have an actual house to come home to every night rather than a tiny hotel room. the kitchen had food in it already, so we were able to wait until the next day to do our grocery shopping. the air conditioning worked well. the furnishings were nice. having a computer with internet access was also wonderful so that we could research any places before visiting. we ended up being able to park right on the street out front once we got a (free) permit from the police dept. stephen was super helpful whenever we had any questions, but the best and most helpful things he offered were rides into downtown in the mornings. the parking near the main sightseeing spots is horrendous, but he was wonderful about taking us to whatever spot we planned to start our day at. then we just took a cab or the metro/bus system back in the afternoon. we really enjoyed our stay. we know we could have never found a better spot for accommodations, location, and hosts. we would definitely like to stay here again if life brings us back to d.c."
27281,55368,2010-06-20,63752,Sofia,"stephen was a wonderful host! the apartment we stayed in was clean and nicely decorated. the kitchen was stocked with snacks and a bottle of wine was complimentary! information on local restaurants were placed on the counter and we had access to the computer for internet. stephen was always available by phone if we needed anything and even when we were leaving after our stay, he gave us a ride to our next destination. i would highly recommend staying at stephen's. it was our first airbnb experience and stephen definitely made a wonderful first impression to my partner and i for this site. we would happily use stephen's place in the future. "
27281,62224,2010-07-07,155290,Patricia,"stephen's apartment was perfect for our four-day stay in washington, d.c. we were there during a heat wave, temperatures around 100, but we didn't even need to turn on the a/c. the bed was very comfortable, and he provided all kinds of extras to make our stay even more pleasant.  a fully stocked refrigerator, a computer with internet connection, all the conveniences of home.  there is a bus stop a block from the apartment that goes to lafayette square near the white house, but we also found that cabs were easy to come by and relatively inexpensive.  i hope he continues to rent out his apartment to other fortunate short-term visitors to the capitol.  "
27281,65114,2010-07-16,125979,Ari,"my partner, charles, and i just spend a lovely five days in d.c., and stephen's apartment was the perfect crash pad.  it was so nice to come back here after a long, hot day traipsing around the city--there was air conditioning, cable t.v., and a fully stocked kitchen.  and the bed was so comfortable!  much better than most hotel beds, in my opinion.  stephen was a great host--he recommended restaurants and sites to visit, gave us a short driving tour of the capitol area, and even drove us to the airport!  i highly recommend booking a stay with stephen whenever you come to d.c."
27281,67138,2010-07-21,133118,Jessica,"stephen was a wonderful host!  he picked us up from union station, gave us great tips on getting around dc, and restaurant recommendations as well as providing a clean and comfortable place to stay.  there are bus stops close by as well as restaurants (souk on h street was delicious).  the apartment was cool and comfortable.  it was a little noisy upstairs when the cleaning service came, but they were in and out fairly quickly.  highly recommend staying with stephen.!"
27281,71526,2010-07-31,158186,Steve,"we had a wonderful time.  stephen is a great host. he made the stay very welcoming with a stocked refrigerator and cabinet and complimentary wine and beer (and some great coffee). the apartment was clean and comfortable.  the bed was very comfortable and the air mattress worked out fine for our teenager. in the 100 degree heat, it was great to come back after a long day to a nice air-conditioned space with all the comforts of home. the internet access and computer, large screen tv, and cd collection were much appreciated. we were always able to find street parking either right in front or just a few doors away thanks to the free parking permit which stephen drove us to the police station to get.  although we used the well-equipped kitchen to make some meals, there are lots of interesting looking restaurants in the area. i would definitely stay at stephen's apartment on our next trip to d.c.!"
27281,73501,2010-08-04,131097,Rachel,"stephen was so wonderful and friendly! the place was clean and nice, and there was wine and pizza and coffee and so much more already in the apartment - the deal was great and very generous of stephen and we were very pleased. the place had internet, but not wifi - therefore the lack of the last star, we are ipad people and need wifi! really close to downtown and he lent us his printer when we needed it too! "
32087,567384,2011-09-25,1192632,Sven,"very accommodating host, curteous, beautiful location in the heart of dc, beautiful rooms and yummy breakfast french-style."

32087,5389855,2013-06-27,4642537,Yve,"staying at american guest house was the best decision i could have made while on official business lobbying for foreign policy and the international affairs budget with senators and congressman, so my stay was very short. they were flexible with check in hours and with departure, and the room was as quaint and as neat as the entire premise. my hosts were just as inviting and even left me breakfast to go. would recommend to anyone wanting an intimate feel while in a big city setting. "
32584,54212,2010-06-17,142677,Rob,this is the only place i'll stay when i am in dc. chris and his brother james made our stay one of the best! 5 stars. thanks again guys!
32584,58556,2010-06-28,142481,Cathy,"chris and the carriage house rocked! he is pleasant, attentive and always available. while there my mother, son and i needed a few things. he was there for us when we needed him and super friendly. the stairs are steep and my son is small so he even bought a baby gate for the apartment to keep my son from getting  hurt. 

the carriage house was neat, clean and had a ton of character. there are 2 queen beds and a ton of pillows. there is an armoire with hangers and the bathroom (shower only)  has nice new towels. a decent fridge,  microwave and cups, plates, silverware, etc are also there. we were able to save a ton of money by not having to eat out every meal. 

the location was within a 5 minute walk of the shaw metro stop and 15 minutes of the convention center. there was a giant grocery store about 10 minutes south. the neighborhood is mixed and most people were very friendly. 

i plan to stay here next time i am in town. "
32584,60028,2010-07-02,147039,Betsy,"thank you chris for all your help!! chris was very helpful with directions and suggestion, before we were even heading to dc. he met us at the metro, which was very close to his place. thanks chris for hauling my luggage to your place. he and his brother were very kind, and helpful on getting us set up with internet when we got there. and assured us, that if we needed anything, to please call. the place was roomy, and clean. chris called us, during our stay. just to check on how we were, and if we needed anything. but he still gave us our privacy, which was very nice. thanks again!!"
32584,61430,2010-07-05,151847,Jess,"the carriage house and chris were both amazing.  we had a great stay and chris was really helpful when we needed suggestions on where to go.
the metro train was super close and made it really easy to get around the town.
"
32584,63544,2010-07-11,150933,Melinda,"staying in the carriage house was great - the price can't be beat and it suited my needs perfectly. for someone who is a less-touristy traveler (i was in dc for house-hunting), the location is ideal because it's centrally located and super metro-convenient. "
32584,64454,2010-07-13,135700,Robert,"chris's place was very comfortable - as described!  great aircon, great bed, great couch, clean, good bathroom, shower, towels, linens etc.  chris was very responsive and easy to communicate with.  we had a small glitch on timing our arrival but chris dropped everything and zoomed over to check us in himself so we wouldn't be inconvenienced - very good!  wifi is from house across the patio, so a bit weak.  entrance through the garage/carriage house and upstairs is a bit sketchy - you need to have a sense of adventure and not be afraid of open stair treads and a little garage experience - on your way to a very cute loft studio! we would stay again!     "
32584,64926,2010-07-15,148825,Jeff,"so many positives...  chris communicated amazingly well before, during and after the visit.  his brother james welcomed us and made sure everything was working well.  being able to park a car in the neighborhood was key to me renting this location.  inside, the a/c was ice-cold, beds comfortable, bathroom excellent and there were even some utensils and a small refridgerator so we could keep some food cold.  as soon as chris realized the wifi was down, he arranged for a very fair refund to compensate for the inconvenience.  if i ever choose to come back to dc, i wouldn't hesitate to rent this spot again.

32584,70918,2010-07-30,149443,Theresa,"we had a fantastic time in dc and the carriage house was wonderful.  chris was great about meeting us to get us set up, recommending places to eat, and answering any questions we had.  the carriage house itself was perfect!  the air-conditioning worked wonders after the heat of dc, the beds were comfortable, and the location worked great - close to the metro.  would definitely call chris to stay again at the carriage house.   "
32584,73212,2010-08-03,148126,Thierry,"chris's apartment is very well located: close to subway and to downtown. the apartment is clean, clear, comfortable and well equiped. there is not a real kitchen but everything is done to make your stay in washington dc pleasant (glasses, plates, spoons, forks, knives are provided). chris and his family are very nice and helpful. we really spent good time there.

so we recommanded chris's address if you want to stay several days in washington dc.

32584,75561,2010-08-08,109319,Lynda,"chris and james are really nice people (didn't get to meet joe).  the studio is very clean and comfortable.  it is spacious, and has a work space, fridge and plates/cutlery.  we really enjoyed our stay there, and when my friend hurt her foot on the day of our departure, james was an angel sent from heaven :)

the studio apratment is really close to the centre of dc.  we walked home one night from china town. a bus stop and the subway station are only a few minutes walk, but we ended up just catching taxis from the side of the main road (around the corner from the studio) as it was a really cheap option for the two of us (only $8 including tip, so $4 each)."
32584,77124,2010-08-11,193658,Benn,"chris and his brother were very accommodating, especially on short notice. as a first time user of airbnb, i found that last minute travel is a spotty venture at best. however, they were understanding of my situation and made our stay enjoyable.

location is not bad, and walkable or a cheap taxi ride away from the monuments. there's a grocery story and a few restaurants pretty close. overall, i had a pretty good stay and i'd definitely recommend the place to someone who doesn't feel like staying in a pricey dc hotel."
32584,86454,2010-08-29,160505,Charles,"cozy , very private and funky in  a good way, chris' place was set up in a very comfortable way and in a great location , just far enough from downtown and the mall so it was nice and quiet and yet very close to fine dining and whole foods
there was a problem with the wifi, apparently from a new modem he had just installed but , chris was tenacious in taking the time to fix it, so overall a satisfying experience."
32584,88401,2010-09-01,196404,Nicole,the carriage house is fantastic. well secured and in an accessible area. chris was great as well. he was extremely helpful. we had a great time. thanks!
32584,96673,2010-09-14,163658,Heather,"good facilities for the price.  has basic supplies of dishes etc. and computer and wifi. although the apartment is secure, entering off an alley is less than ideal in this location, but we had no problems.  "
32584,99575,2010-09-18,192215,Adeline,"chris' carriage house was perfect for our time in dc. it is very comfortable, spacious, and accessible to sites whether walking, biking, or using the metro.
while we never met chris, his input via emails and info left in the house was very helpful.
i highly recommend this wonderful little gem of a place.

32584,106265,2010-09-27,53649,Zahra,"the carriage house is pretty good value for money. it's private and spacious. when you first enter, it seems  like its a storage area/work space, though once you get upstairs all of that is transformed. the pictures are accurate, what you see is definitely what you get! chris was really prompt in his communications and sent some really useful information with the check-in details. would definitely recommend as an alternative to pricey dc hotels!"
32584,109168,2010-10-01,192863,Kendra,"we had a great time at the carriage house. the room was incredibly spacious, clean, well furnished and comfortable. also the location was perfect. although it might not be in dupont circle, it was right near the metro (literally one block) and in walking distance of the grocery store as well as good places to eat. on top of all that chris and his brother were very helpful and left us detailed instructions on how to check in (and out) as well as some great suggestions on places to go in the area. overall, a very great experience. we wish we could have stayed longer!"
32584,112000,2010-10-05,180181,Sandra,we had a great time. we got very helpful informations and everything runs well. only using the key is a little bit adventure ;-)  
32584,120801,2010-10-17,248077,Clare,"great space, reminded me of home (brooklyn) as did the 'hood. loved being upstairs with plenty of space and light. the place is well stocked with towels, sheets, dishes, coffee etc. chris was very responsive when the electricity went out temporarily one morning, but luckily it was daytime and the hot water heater still worked. easy to get into, with motion sensors in the courtyard and inside the storage area, which was nice and tidy. the metro a block away was handy, as was being walking distance to the convention center. no taxis on the street though, but plenty if you go out and come home. only complaint was there was no lamp next to the bed. would definitely stay there again. 
"
32584,123057,2010-10-20,162886,Mauro,"the apartment was great, chris have a clean and cozy studio. he also leave a lot of information about washington dc. the only problem that we saw was the area, we didn´t fell very safe but nothing happens... the subway is 2 min walking. the entrace is a litlle scary but in the end is only a garage."

32584,137580,2010-11-12,11457,John,"we had a great stay at the carriage house.  the apartment was just as advertised, in a very convenient and pleasant location.  it was roomy, neat and clean.  the remuzzi brothers provided lots of information about local restaurants, attractions, etc.  because they got us a parking pass, we were able to park our car in the street without hassle or expense and take advantage of the metro.  they were prompt and precise in their communications.  the only problem was that we had to leave after four days!  we would highly recommend this apartment to anyone."

32584,151591,2010-12-10,278638,Beverly,"we had a wonderful stay at the carriage house.  the place is not far from the metro station which allowed us easy access to the site.  the instructions provided by the remuzzi brothers were very detailed and easy to follow.  the many brochures, flyers and references around the neighborhood was a nice addition to our stay.  the carriage house was warm and cozy considering we were in dc during a cold snap. we definitely would consider booking the carriage house again when we return to dc. thank you remuzzi brothers for a wonderful place.  beverly  "
32584,153702,2010-12-14,251588,Leann,"the carriage house was great-a nice, warm place to go after a chilly day of sightseeing. the instructions for getting in were very clear, and everything felt very private and secure. really close to the metro-2-3 minute walk, at most. the comforter on the bed is super fluffy and warm (i'm now convinced i need one on my own bed at home) and there's a brochure for just about everything. all in all, i'd definitely recommend this place to a friend.

32584,160535,2010-12-30,148468,James,"i had a great stay at the carriage house for 3 nights. that i got an extra night available before the majot snowstorm hits eastern usa. the studio apartment was in a very convenient and pleasant location. it was roomy, neat and clean. there are lots of information about local restaurants, attractions, etc at the room table. was glad that chris got me a parking pass, that i wasable to park my car in the street for four days without hassle or expense and take advantage of the metro. they were prompt and precise in their communications when i relied text communications mostly in e-mails that i found it very helpful. i appreciated that from their communications to me.i wished  i stasyed in dc bit longer, so much to see and visit at the time of year just after christmas holidays. i will definately book this carriage house again when i visit dc in near future. so i would highly recommend this studio apartment to anyone through airbnb. i'll tell my friends and to anyone, it will save you lots on money in this place with a very nice neighborhood too, instead of a one-room standard hotel!

cheers & best wishes in 2011!.

32584,184466,2011-02-19,431,Matthew,"i had an excellent stay in the carriage house. the room itself is spacious and well-furnished, and the central heating made for a very comfortable experience even during the cold february nights. i appreciate the details like the tea selection, the clear arrival instructions, the local recommendations, and even the fresh flower in the room. i'd be happy to stay again."

32584,201166,2011-03-17,334168,Josh,"the carriage house was clean, comfortable and absolutely as advertised. the remuzzis have obviously put a lot of hard work and attention into their place. it was perfect for our family (me, my wife and six-year old) as we explored dc and northern virginia. proximity to downtown and the metro was the most important feature for us, with comfort and security also ranking highly. the carriage house scores five stars in each of those categories. you can be anywhere in dc in just minutes from this spot, and we never had any doubts about our decision.

the remuzzis were always just a phone call or email away if we had any questions. they are very responsive. getting in and out of the carriage house was super-simple thanks to the detailed document they provide prior to check-in. it also contains a whole lot of information about the neighborhood and city, and the apartment is full of brochures and maps.

don't pay crazy hotel prices when you can get everything you need and some personality right here. stay remuzzi!"
32584,206126,2011-03-22,351150,Katy,"we highly recommend the carriage house for a stay in dc. it's spacious, clean and light, with comfortable bed and necessary amenities. the location was ideal - 1.5 mile walk to the mall, local restaurants with good food and friendly service, great local cafe (big bear), easy access to metro and bikes (capitol bikeshare), and interesting local history and architecture to explore. remuzzi brothers were helpful and responsive - provide an information packet to make arrival and stay easy and enjoyable. we hope to stay again."
32584,208488,2011-03-25,242842,Polly,"this place was perfect for me and my 21 year old son.  it was a 5 minute walk from the shaw-howard univ metro stop.  also it is only about a 35-40 minute walk to the capitol building down new jersey ave.  it was clean and spacious with great lighting.  we did not use the washer/dryer but it was nice to know it was there!  the internet access was quick and easy.
lots of literature in the unit making it easy to find my way around dc.  and several menus of local places to get food.
i would not recommend walking around the neighborhood too much after dark although i felt it was pretty safe.  just use common sense.
the remuzzi provided excellent directions about how to get into the unit.  i would stay there again."
32584,219571,2011-04-07,264933,Patty,"we loved our stay at the carriage house! it was so nice to have the metro blocks away and the remuzzi brothers gave great tips about the neighborhood. they were awesome about communicating with me before and during my stay! they supplied us with a ton of sight seeing information. we can't wait to call the carriage house ""home"" again when we come to dc again."

close to transport, and food: the metro is really close! so we used that every day to make our way downtown. there's a chinese takeaway almost across the road, and a 7 eleven close, with a bigger supermarket not too far away.  

fluffy towels, sightseeing pamphlets, and internet access! 
we loved staying with you, we hope many others do too! trb were so helpful and communicative every step of the way with our booking, we couldnt have asked for more.  "
32584,247400,2011-05-02,348309,Giulio,great place as a base to visit the city. kitchen is just a microwave so best to eat out but not a massive issue.
32584,251070,2011-05-04,420117,Anne,"my husband,15 y.o. daughter and i spent 3 fabulous days and 2 nights in washington.the carriage house was exactly as it was described and portrayed on the internet. clean, neat, quality linens and towels and the washing machine and drier were really handy. there were lots of brochures about washington and the carriage house was easy to find and access via self check-in.we didn't have any problems in our short stay or meet the hosts but there were phone numbers if we needed to make contact. it was conveniently located a short walk to the metro, 2 or 3 stops and you were in down town washington. there was a 7/11 convenience store about 500m away and the red torque cafe, which serves excellent food, about 200m away. there is no kitchen as such but we were able to have cereal for breakfast and make tea and coffee. it is also possible to eat take out in the carriage house as plates and cutlery are provided. all in all a very good experience. australia."
32584,254438,2011-05-07,515912,Trina,"wonderful visit to the carriage house. accommodations were great, check in and check out were easy and the parking pass was invaluable. highly recommend and would definitely stay there again."
32584,257499,2011-05-09,551361,Marian,"our stay at the remuzzi brothers' carriage house was fantastic. it was cute and clean and gave us easy access to all that dc has to offer. also, all the pamphlets and maps provided made our trip easy, easy. thanks so much!"
32584,289462,2011-05-31,361045,Lauren,"excellent location due north of the national gallery of art.  we walked everywhere night and day although it's very convenient to the metro.

a clean, comfortable, pleasant, unfussy place with openable windows on three sides, which gave great cross-ventilation in the over-90 weather.  there's also an overhead fan and excellent airconditioning.

enjoyable to stay in a real neighborhood.

information provided on the nearest grocery stores (among other nearby resources) was extremely helpful."
32584,296505,2011-06-04,409912,Susan,thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the carriage house.  each day we had a parking spot just outside our door.  the facility is exactly as represented by the remuzzi brothers.  we will recommend to our friends. 
32584,309190,2011-06-12,433814,Carole,"this was a really great economical way to stay compared to hotel costs.  it was a very quiet neighborhood.  kudos to the remuzzi brothers for getting the parking pass for the street.  we rode the metro bus line everyday, which is very close.  did not eat at any neighbor places as we liked a different type of food.  the refrig and microwave were great to have.  found the local giant food store a couple miles out rhode island (and mcdonald's too) that was cleaner than neighborhood giant foods.  if we ever come back to dc this is where we would stay again!!!! availability of washer and dryer was awsome as well.  thanks for sharing your space with us."
32584,313316,2011-06-14,59728,Allison,"loved our stay!  even before we arrived, there was a detailed pack of information delivered to my inbox that answered every question one could have about travel, parking, transport, the neighborhood, etc. the carriage house is light and airy with plenty of space for the two of us. even though our stay was brief, we would have easily been comfortable during a more extended trip. there were tons of maps, booklets and travel guides for guests' use. the house was easy to find, and is in a central location to access any and everything the district has to offer.  the metro is less than 3 blocks walk, and there is a bus stop around the corner. and finally, the ac worked great on a very hot weekend in dc. highly recommended!"
32584,323290,2011-06-20,392339,Deborah,"our family of four found the carriage house a great place to stay during our washington vacation. we loved the proximity of the metro stop, and it’s a short ride to the national mall. the apartment doesn’t have a real kitchen but is fine for simple breakfasts around the coffee table and is well stocked with “real” and disposable dishes. the ac worked well, the beds were firm, and the washer and dryer handy. the remuzzi brothers were responsive and helpful, and parking was easy and free with a permit they obtained for us.  a very comfortable place to relax after a long day of sightseeing and a good bargain!"
32584,356441,2011-07-06,557735,Thijs,a perfect place to explore the city! i haven't met the remuzzi brothers but communication with them was easy and the guide they give you to get into the place was perfect. it even lists the local eateries and gives you tips on getting around the city. lots of brochures of things to do will never keep you bored in dc.
32584,379350,2011-07-18,306977,Kevin,"overall a great experience. easy check in. the place was bright, sunny & clean. quiet & private. centrally located & only a couple of blocks from the metro made it easy to get around. the washer & dryer was also handy during our extended stay. "
32584,391267,2011-07-23,794987,Peter,the carriage house was great!  it is just as advertised and as others have written.  a very comfortable place to spend my nights while i was in town for business.  and the check in and check out could not have been easier.  i look forward to staying there again!
32584,397741,2011-07-26,572954,Angel,"the pictures reflect the apartment accurately.  it's very functional, clean and has plenty of storage room downstairs for bicycles, camping gear, etc.  the remuzzi bros. really try to think of everything when it comes to satisfying their guests.  the only issue we had was the a/c not keeping up with the 100+ degree temperatures while we were there.  after a quick text message to the remuzzi family, we had a window unit installed the next day!  how's that for service? :d  the neighborhood itself is a little quirky but we never felt in danger or anything - just use common sense and you'll be fine.  looking forward to our next stay at the carriage house!"
32584,403758,2011-07-29,406127,Corenne,accommodation is adequate and clean. the brothers are prompt communicators and their instructions are thorough. 
32584,408631,2011-07-31,751637,John,"this is a great place...very close to the metro and you can be downtown in 10 minutes. also, the neighborhood is quiet and the loft is very private. i travel a lot and am always on the lookout for a bargain... this one is one of the best bargains i have come across in a while. 
when we arrived, we needed a bot of help in getting a parking pass and the ramuzzi brothers took care of it overnight... i had a pass the next day on my front door. what a great bunch of guys....we will be staying there often."
32584,418803,2011-08-04,455087,Bruce,we loved our stay in the carriage house in washington.  it was the perfect base for our short stay for our family of four.  the remuzzi bros were very helpful with the useful information sent before our stay.
32584,427428,2011-08-08,190600,Susan And Ivan,"the carriage house was perfect for my dc conference -- super clean, comfortable, and walking distance from the convention center and numerous restaurants and shops. also, the remuzzi brothers were great hosts. when minor check-in glitches occurred, they responded immediately. i will definitely stay here on future trips to dc. thanks! "
32584,435603,2011-08-10,835229,Jaio,"loved the place, very comfortable, clean and full of nice details, better than we expected. the neighborhood is very cool and hip. we are very grateful the brothers could get us a parking notice at such short notice. you made our stay in washington :))))))"
32584,449257,2011-08-16,567639,Francesco,"we had a really nice time in the carriage house! it is a nice cozy place to stay, really convenient with the metro just steps away, and absolutely confortable. the brothers were really helpful already before our trip, helping out with planning, and also during our stay they were really nice and helpful. we particularly appreciated the self check-in/check-out process, which really makes everything run smoother, and gives the feeling of being hosted at a friend's house."
32584,454986,2011-08-18,566929,Serena,"the remuzzi brothers' apt in one word: perfect! near the subway station, clean, comfortable, and good neighbourhood.

the hosts are helpful and polite. a misunderstanding regarding the car immediately resolved!

if we come back to capitol city, we'd love to stay here again! "
32584,473785,2011-08-25,598813,Andrea,"the place was adorable, in a cute-somewhat quite but safe neighborhood. only downfall was the internet service. i thought i might very well be 90 years old before the page would load. otherwise it was amazing, loads of information, maps, pamphlets, etc. washer dryer, etc. "
32584,486960,2011-08-30,531763,Pat,great location and very private and clean. lots of dc info there to refer to. we enjoyed staying there sheltered from hurricane irene.
32584,497060,2011-09-03,602583,Arnold,"excellent place to stay. there is large room with double bed plus sofa that converts to another double bed. air con works very well as does free wi-fi. fridge, washing machine, dryer and microwave provided. only about 20 minutes walk into town.  metro station and food stores a few minutes away. brothers provide excellent briefing document and were very responsive to my enquiries."
32584,514977,2011-09-09,549371,Pablo,"as the carriage house is a self-checkin apt we didn't meet the remuzzi brothers. the brochure they provide in advance is very helpful not only with regards to the apt location but also dealing with local venues and useful info.
we were a bit surprised to notice that despite there's a lady that does all the cleaning prior to the guests' arrival, we could still find a sticky bathroom floor.
the place itself is good for two people but we wouldn't recommend it for 3 or 4, although it's true there's a convertible sofa. there's no kitchen so don't expect to cook anything other than microwave stuff :)
although my wife is a bit paranoid, i must say i loved the neighbourhood and it was really enjoyable to walk around. the apt location itself was good enough for going to the usual places in washington dc.
wifi service was superb., btw.

generally speaking, the place was quite good although we think its value shines for 2-3 days. for a more lengthy visit we would recommend looking for more confy places."
32584,523821,2011-09-12,914832,Dee,"we had a great stay in the carriage house.  the location is very good being just a couple of blocks from the subway.  this made it easy for us to get back and forth.  the subway was under construction while we were there and that complicated things, but is no reflection on the carriage house.  we were there during a major rainstorm and so had some complications with the gate lock as the wood had swollen and it was difficult to open, there was also a modest leak in the roof that caused water to drip from the exhaust fan in the bathroom.  i was impressed that there was an umbrella to use, but alas it was broken so we could not use it.  the local giant grocery store closed down for renovations so we had to walk to the wholefoods in logan square.  i prefer wholefoods so that was okay, but it is a bit of a walk.  we had a good meal from the red toque cafe across the street.  i would recommend them for kebabs.  it was great having high speed internet to hook into so the absence of a television was not missed at all.  it was very nice to have all of the literature available on dc and although we did not use the washer and dryer i can see how that would be a great benefit to some people.  over all a pretty good experience with some frustrations that weren't really the fault of the remuzzi brothers.  i have learned that travel many times equals frustration so you just have to put up with it if you want to get any where."
32584,550451,2011-09-20,973790,Bonaventura,"great apartement, great location!! everything was perfect."
32584,564620,2011-09-25,739979,Dan,"lovely apartment, excellent location, easy to find. clear, detailed instructions from the remuzzi bros received prior to arrival. would definately recommend to friends and a visit to neighbouring u street is definately well worth it."
32584,582292,2011-09-30,347339,Alex,"exactly as described by the rmb. great location to the subway, with local food restaurants and take aways plentiful. we enjoyed the torque cafe and the queen of sheba ethopian. for more mainline food and shopping, go  to colombia heights on the subway. the only thing we did not find in the neighbourhood was a local bar to sit out and have a beer, though the liquor store around the corner was very convenient. 
thanks very much."
32584,597263,2011-10-04,828151,Alison,"clean, comfortable, and accessible. a good place to stay."
32584,629518,2011-10-15,432725,Richard,"the carriage house is barely adequate for a stay of over a few days. it is much like visiting someone's basement. the fence, outside, is almost falling down. inside, everything is rough finished and temporary; plastic curtains rather than drywall, steps upstairs are unfinished.
refrigerator and microwave work, but no sink for washing dishes. adequate for a short visit."
32584,656889,2011-10-24,695470,Stephanie,"our stay at the carriage house was great! the place is really nice, clean and with lots of light - and since it is located down an alley, you are not at all disturbed by the noise of cars from the street. it has all the basics, and it is especially nice with the fridge + microwave, so you don't have to go out to eat all the time. if you fell like takeout, beau thai is amazing and very near by! also, it is really close to the metro, so access to downtown is no problem. we had some problems with our luggage, which came late at night - and the remuzzi bros were so helpful and did their best to assist us! we would definitely stay at the carriage house again, if we come back to dc! "
32584,665455,2011-10-26,134758,Eihway,"the self checkin worked great. i had no problems and the neighborhood seems fine. it's close to very attractive walking areas. it was very helpful to have a workstation, too."
32584,685787,2011-11-02,735251,Yuka,"carriage house is exactly as described.  the room is fairly large, comfortable, and very private.  it's located near howard/shaw metro station, about 3-minute walk.  there aren't many things between the station and the house, except for 7-eleven.  it would have been nice if there was a coffee shop nearby, but we just made our own coffee in the room instead.  the room comes with a coffee machine, an electric kettle, a fridge, a microwave oven, and a bunch of dishes and silverware, so it was nice to be able to fix up some breakfast before we start the day.  it doesn't have a tv, but we didn't really need one after a long day of sightseeing.  we streamed some shows on our ipad via wifi at the house one night, which was sufficient.

another nice thing was that it has washer/dryer downstairs.  since i was running a marathon in dc, not having to drag all the sweaty running clothes home was a huge plus.  

although there weren't too many places to eat around the area, we hang out in u street area for dinner and drinks, which is just one metro station north.  it's actually a walking distance from carriage house.  we missed the last train one night, and stumbled home, just fine.  

the rm brothers were very good about giving us instructions on how to get to the house and tips for touring around the city.  they laid out some brochures from different places in the area, which was helpful.  they were also really good about replying to email and phone calls promptly.  we really appreciated when we called and left a message about leaving our luggage at the house after checking out, chris called us back twice to make sure we got the message.

would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay at a reasonably priced and conveniently located little home away from home in dc."
32584,714193,2011-11-13,176384,Judith,"the carriage house was lovely. large and spacious, it was well equipped and the bed was very comfortable. the metro was nearby which made traveling around washington very easy."
32584,726197,2011-11-17,450276,Sarah,"we had a great stay at the carriage house because it's very close to everything, especially public transportation. we really appreaciated all the maps and brochures about local attactrations and services. the curculator information was especially helpful. our only feedback would be that the gate is hard to close and open, it'd be great to have a newer computer that offers quicker internet access and a printer for boarding passes, and it would be nicet o have a hook or two on the bathroom door for extra towels and night clothes. the bed was very comfortable, the shower was great, and the heater works excellently. overall, we had a wonderful trip! "
32584,731314,2011-11-20,332656,Madeleine,"the remuzzi brothers are absolutely wonderful hosts.  they were very easy to get a hold of and extremely responsive.   i had forgotten to write down how to get in - which i realized after a very long day at a conference.  around 9.30 at night, i called and they picked up immediately.  i was in in no time! i really liked the brothers - they were great! the carriage house was very nice and comfortable (bed gets an a++++ ebay style).  the 7-11 around the corner was great and the subway stop was only a short walk away.  i think its great for anyone on a budget.        "
32584,744098,2011-11-26,1124561,Paige,the carriage house was a great place for us to stay. the place was tidy and our hosts were extremely communicative and flexible for our needs. thanks again!
32584,761772,2011-12-04,1140284,Jennifer,"the carriage house is private and the self check in is great.  directions to and for the rental are very clear.  it is a no frills, clean, comfortable place.  it is a little off the beaten path but the metro is close.  oh, the neighborhood is quiet and we liked the access to the internet and old school stereo.  overall, we recommend the carriage house--solid 4. "
32584,772724,2011-12-09,8919,James,"great alternative to d.c. hotels, a far better value. comfy bed, nice space, quiet, clean, skylights and just a mini-fridge, microwave and coffee maker but that worked for us. 

getting into and checking out couldn't have been easier. it's a 2 block walk to shaw metro and various bus lines.

wifi is ok but byo laptop as the computer provided is too slow even for web stuff."
32584,789244,2011-12-17,828830,Luke,"had a great stay in the carriage house. check in was a breeze, the house is clean and comfortable and the location is great. all the major attractions are around a half an hour walk away or there is the metro line just around the corner. would happily stay here again if we return to washington d.c."
32584,802761,2011-12-24,435011,Debora,i liked the studio. everything near. they were really nice when needed. lost of information about  washington d.c at the studio!
32584,807597,2011-12-27,1308149,Rebecca,"this was a lovely, private and quiet place that was conveniently located.  i would definitely come back."
32584,821870,2012-01-02,942915,Theresa,"we stayed here for a week and it fit our needs nicely. great location, especially since we arrived on the metro, which was nearby. be sure to go to beau thai and busboys and poets while there. "
32584,868653,2012-01-17,28670,Mark And Iris,very comfortable stay in this clean and convenient studio.  many thoughtful touches and the hosts were quick to answer any questions we had.  we will definitely stay again on our trips to visit our son who lives nearby in this great location in dc.  
32584,874103,2012-01-21,495214,Katherine,"was a great place to stay! check in and out was really easy!
the ""kitchen"" is very basic and we were confused as to where to wash dishes (ended up having to use the bathroom sink) but other then that everything was fine. was an easy walk to the metro that took you directly downtown!"
32584,885582,2012-01-27,1164761,Rosalie,"the carriage house is just perfect. absolutely private, great location, charming.  i loved it.  take your instructions because a lot of streets come together right in that location and you can get confused on the address.  that is a two minute issue - then you're in and it's just perfect.  "
32584,896411,2012-02-01,1582026,Kathie,"the carriage house was perfect for our stay in dc.  clean, comfortable and great location.  check in info was very detailed, we had no issues with the self-check in process.  had concerns about the street parking but it was fine.   lots of neighborhood info provided by the r brothers.  would definitely use again.  "
32584,905140,2012-02-06,1643529,Tanja,"great place for a weekend in dc.  great location and easy to get from there to the rest of dc.  it is very quiet and private.  
"
32584,916631,2012-02-13,1208231,Nadia,"this was my first airbnb experience, and i'll be doing it again!  the carriage house was cute, comfortable, and convenient.  the remuzzi bros were very accommodating, providing detailed directions, check-in information, and lots of tips about the area."
32584,930896,2012-02-19,1338905,Jane & Brent,"the remuzzi brothers were readily available regarding communication, and the place is clean, cozy and close to the train station, which is important as it is a long walk to get into the downtown area. it was also great to have access to a washer and dryer. "
32584,962176,2012-03-01,1693751,Erin,"the carriage house is in a great location (close to restaurants, metro stop) and was a very comfortable place to stay while we visited friends and saw the sights in dc. my mother and i shared the space, and there is room for even more people to sleep here if necessary. the large bed and futon were both comfortable, and we loved having access to a mini-fridge, toaster, coffeemaker, and hot pot so we could prepare some of our own snacks and have tea or coffee in the morning. the free laundry was very helpful since i was in the middle of a longer trip and needed to refresh my wardrobe. would highly recommend, and would definitely stay here again in the future!"
32584,977924,2012-03-07,105602,Eli,"first the important stuff:
these guys are professionals. from the pre-book to the check-in, to responding to issues that arose during the stay, they belong in the hospitality business. they let me drop my bags off waaay before my check in and everything in the apartment was as advertised.

there were a couple issues that arose during my stay that were out of their control (issues with comcast internet mostly) but they were accommodating and did everything they could to fix it. all in all a very positive experience"
32584,985169,2012-03-10,1704185,Ina (Josefine),"the carriage house is a comfortable place in an interesting neighborhood and is conveniently located within walking distance of downtown. the area has a variety of eclectic restaurants, all within blocks of the apartment. the carriage house is private, quiet, and the bed was really comfortable! parking was good too. without a proper kitchenette, preparing meals and doing dishes was awkward but having a washer and dryer was a real bonus. "
32584,1012249,2012-03-18,1553023,Meghan,"carriage house was perfect for our stay--thank you! two block walk to metro, short 5 minute ride to most any location. easy check in/check out system and brand new flat screen t.v. the washer and dryer were great, and the space on the first floor to store empty luggage bags left us with plenty of room upstairs. we had a great time, and would love to stay again."
32584,1034012,2012-03-23,1654611,Gee,"apartment was adequate for our stays in washington, everything clean, and nice and close to a underground station which was very convenient."
32584,1042487,2012-03-26,1543205,Cathy,"we loved our stay at the carriage house. it was conveniently located (the subway was two short blocks away), the central ac was swift and cool, and we made use of the laundry room and the dvd player. there are all kinds of maps and restaurant menus made available to us, and we definitely appreciated them. we were attending a poetry festival around the u district area, and we opted to walk. it took about ten to twelve minutes to get there. we also took the subway two stops up to columbia heights--everything was super-convenient and close by. the room was also clean/cleaned while we were there.

the internet was down for some of the weekend, but we were kept in the loop--and the internet was fixed by the third night of our stay. joe was really flexible with us in our check-out time, and we appreciated that. the carriage house is on the second floor, with a washer/dryer on the first floor, as well as a tools and other things behind a curtain on the first floor. so, very occasionally, someone might knock and call out that he's putting tools away and such. overall, it was a great space. it was spring, the cherry blossoms were blooming, and birds were singing in the morning. i felt safe walking through the neighborhood at night. highly recommended."
32584,1063357,2012-03-31,1598018,Kristian,a nice and clean place to stay fairly close to the centre of dc. if you're not up for the walk downtown the metro is literally a stones throw away. definently worth the price anytime!
32584,1084701,2012-04-05,1165706,Charles,"this was my first experience using air bnb.  i heard about the site on npr just as i was planning a sightseeing trip to dc.   the carriage house provided excellent accommodations for me and my son for our trip to dc.  the place was clean and comfortable and provided excellent access to metro transit and a capital bike share station.  just as advertised.  we enjoyed the quiet, privacy and convenient location.  i would definately stay here again or recommend it to others.  "
32584,1100431,2012-04-09,1479368,Alexia,"good location, not in the middle of everything, but the metro station is close by and it's only a few stops to get to all the attractions and lots of nice places to eat. it was easy to get into, the instructions sent by the brothers before our stay were comprehensive and easy to follow. the bed was comfy. the fold out bed was big and easy to use, but perhaps a bit hard to sleep on for an extended stay. everything was clean and organised. i'd suggest leaving your bags downstairs as the stairs felt a bit steep."
32584,1110455,2012-04-12,858096,Robert,"nice space.  a bit complicated to find, but the remuzzi brothers sent really, really good instructions along with recommendations on local restaurants and cafes.  other highlights are: excellent wifi, quiet neighborhood and clean space."
32584,1154029,2012-04-20,1300028,Ray,"great space. . . clean, good light, thoughtful touches (like a washer and dryer; so helpful!).  the short, easy walk to the metro made the whole city available to us, while experiencing the charm of a vibrant neighborhood, rather than a sterile hotel.  thank you!"
32584,1174748,2012-04-24,1697611,Denis,a really unique and private place. the location near the metro is perfect. the information package was quite complete. it was very clean. really nice vacation in washington for us. 
32584,1224801,2012-05-04,1453881,Johannes,"we had a great stay at the carriage house. clean, quiet and very well organized hosts. "
32584,1234067,2012-05-06,894349,Douglas David,our family of 3 thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the carriage house.  it had all of the comforts of home and was convenient to seeing the downtown sights in dc.  thanks!
32584,1246055,2012-05-08,1806132,Gabriel,"the place was conveniently located and the checklist sent to me before my trip was super helpful in finding our way to the carriage house. <its only a short 15 min walk to u street. great place, totally private and very well equipped with all the stuff u may need like kettle, brochures. all in all, a delightful place!"
32584,1274641,2012-05-14,1265520,Natalie,"the carriage house is clean, spacious, and equipped with endless amenities - computer, tv, ipod player, hairdryer, washing machine, first aid kit, coffee maker, plates & cutlery - to make it a very enjoyable stay. the bed was comfortable, the bathroom had an excellent shower.

it's very close to a metro stop, and we loved a nearby restaurant called bistro bohem (along 6th st)

only small issues would be the slow wireless internet, and the skylights can wake you up quite early."
32584,1288975,2012-05-16,1580046,Stefan,"the apartment is very well located and the metro is just around the corner. the apartment is quiet and comfortable and we had everything we needed (and even the opportunity to wash our clothes, which was great). although we didn't see our hosts, they were easy to communicate with and offered detailed instructions on restaurants, cafés and shops nearby. we tried the big bear café, the beau thai and the red toque café and they were all great. we enjoyed the privacy of the apartment and the self check-in works fine. a great place to stay and highly recommended!"
32584,1333473,2012-05-23,1544890,Barbara,"a great place to stay in dc, understanding that it's essentially a studio apartment with minimal kitchen support. there's a microwave, mini-fridge, a cabinet with plates, cups, glassware and utensils and an assortment of things guests leave behind, ie. tea bags, some dry condiments, paper napkins, etc.. dishes need to be cleaned in either the bathroom sink or downstairs in the utility sink. there's a clothes washer/dryer available and if you had a bicycle, there's plenty of storage space on the first floor. the upstairs has a number of windows, a few skylights providing lots of natural light and good airflow. it's a 'free-standing' building, so there's no up-stairs noise, or through the wall noise, and although there was construction in the alley, we hardly heard it with the doubled glazed windows. the owners are very attentive and accessible. the neighborhood had no food stores, and few restaurants, buying food/snacks elsewhere is advisable. a great place to stay, when i'm in dc i'll book it again!"
32584,1349150,2012-05-26,1596452,Priscilla,"lovely place within a 3 minute walk from the metro station! everything is just like you see on the photos. would absolutely recommend to all my friends!

32584,1496014,2012-06-17,1207852,Maria,"everything was great, the carriage house is situated 3 min walking from the metro. the remuzzi brothers have everything you need for a nice sightseeing program. it was a good choice!"

32584,1553124,2012-06-25,1298838,Carlos,"hemos pasado un fin de semana magnífico en el apartamento de los remuzzi brothers, el apartamento es luminoso, espacioso, muy limpio y agradable.
se encuentra bastante cerca del metro, cruzando dos calles esta la entrada y en unas pocas paradas estas en el mall.  como fuimos en fin de semana no tuvimos ningún problema en aparcar el coche al lado de la casa.
gracias remuzzi brothers por vuestros detalles y atención."

32584,1634119,2012-07-05,2085461,Marni,"had a great stay at the carriage house, kept in contact with the remuzzi brothers before and during my stay and they were willing to help in any way possible.  we arrived at nighttime and it was a tiny bit difficult to figure out the self check-in, but the brothers sent great instructions a few days before check in so we were inside in no time.  we had an issue with the bathroom one night, we called up one of the boys and he came within fifteen minutes, and even went to the hardware store to buy something to fix the issue.  they have thought about everything that you might need, and it was very handy to have a washing machine and dryer as well!  there is also a computer that you can connect to the television to watch movies which was great.  would stay there again for sure, thanks so much guys!"
32584,1673180,2012-07-10,984292,Julien,"what a great place to stay in dc!  you have your own apartment in this great city.
the remuzzi br made every step for check-in very easy with very clear instructions.  
the location is great but be aware that you'll have to walk a good 30 min to go downtown.  that was not a problem for us but it might be for some people.
we would definitely stay there again if we get another chance to go to dc."
32584,1701466,2012-07-14,1437547,Janet,"the carriage house was everything we thought it would be.  it was private, clean and had everything we needed for a 2 night stay.   the remuzzi brothers were very quick to answer any questions we had prior to our visit, and that was really appreciated, since it was our first time in washington, and we really had no idea about where things were.  i would stay there again."
32584,1731329,2012-07-17,2373999,Rebecca,"a lovely, functional, clean space with easy access to the metro. at the end of a long day of training, the tv  offered anyone with familiarity of working with double monitors to go to (website hidden by airbnb) and appreciate the ease with which you can watch recorded tv without cable/satellite hookup. who watches tv live anyway? shorter commercials that way. thanks go out to the three remuzzis!"
32584,1753031,2012-07-20,2432954,Maria,"maria and tom enjoyed the unique experience of staying at the carriage house very much. the  remuzzi brothers gave excellent instructions and directions and returned our call when we had trouble getting in, initially.
the gate is rather difficult to manage but you get the hang of it eventually!

our room was a great refuge from the 105f heat outside!

thank you brothers 3!"

it was in a great neighborhood, we had no problem finding parking nearby every night, the place was clean, cozy and furnished with everything we needed. the washer/dryer came in handy.

the apartment is full of little attentions (touristic flyers and restaurant recommendations, hairdryer, soap, shampoo, conditionner, etc.) we really felt like we were the remuzzi brothers' guests even thought we didn't see them once. 

we loved the fact that it made us feel like we were really living in the city - in our very own apartment. we'd go back anytime."

32584,2434005,2012-09-28,1116746,Diane,"we enjoyed our stay at the carriage house.  it was close to downtown but quiet.  the underground was not far away and a taxi cost appx. $9.00.  there were three of us and there was adequate space for a short stay.
it was spotlessly clean and basically equipped with microwave, toaster, coffee maker, electric jug and fridge.  there is a problem getting the t.v. to work for those that are not techno savvy. (it was mentioned several times in the visitors book).  super little restaurant across the road and more nearby.  recommended."

the subway is only 4 minutes walk away and only a few stops from all the major museums etc.

32584,2783918,2012-11-02,3048709,Lucia,"the house is actually very comfortable and spacious, and is well connected to the city center. if we return to washington we would definitely go back to stay there."

32584,2999192,2012-12-01,3329997,Brittany,"this is a nice place to stay, and i'm glad i did. everything was in order, and it was very clear that they knew what they were doing. the details on how to get in and around, restaurants, and the movies galore were very nice and thoughtful. the apartment was also kept nice and warm, which i appreciated. i had some trouble with the internet, but i don't think it was their fault in any way, and one of the brothers even popped over to see what was wrong, which was very kind. work was paying for this for me, otherwise i do have to admit i think $100 is a bit too steep for the place (though i (website hidden by airbnb) must make a living!). i did find the bathroom to be a wee bit dirty for that price, with some dust about and some of the towels bleach-stained (normally i am a hostel person and wouldn't think twice about this, honestly!). and, i was a little heartbroken that there wasn't any tea in the place--the little console was much heralded in reviews, and it looked to have loads of random coffee, but it was more like a hostel where people had stuck their leftovers (like vegetable oil..? and soy sauce) instead of having just some nice cheap things around for guests. when i realized i was settled in for the night and there was nary a tea bag or powdered creamer i was a bit bummed.  all in all, a safe, pleasant experience, though, in a neighborhood i enjoyed. easy walk to downtown, to boot!  they also responded to a text message when i was in a bit of a pickle and needed to leave my bag behind for a while--very kind. thanks. (postscript: they also send me a note concerning all my feedback, which was thoughtful. apparently i just had to ask about the tea situation--i hadn't wanted to bother anyone about something so small! good to know. thanks, guys.)"

the r. bros also created a very informative check in sheet with everything you need to know.

the carriage house was clean, tidy and very comfortable. there was only two of us but it could have fitted a few more :) "
32584,3120211,2012-12-19,3943154,Dyah,"i highly recommend the carriage house for anyone looking for a place in dc. it was more that anything we expected. i stayed here with two other girls. wish we had more days to spend in dc so that we can stay longer in the carriage house- our dc trip was all about the carriage house :-) it's super clean, great design, we can watch movies from xfinity, it has pc, kitchenette and all, great location, really, nothing to complain about- and the best thing is we could do laundry for free! thank you the remuzzi brothers!"
32584,3142278,2012-12-23,1283082,Patricia A,"we loved the space especially because we either ate out or wanted take out. great location, very comfortable surroundings and look forward to returning. "
32584,3223019,2013-01-02,3645073,Oliver,"the remuzzi's place was cozy and just as shown in the pictures. we had a great time. the entrance is through a laundry room, but once you get upstairs it's a nice space. the instructions they sent before our stay were very comprehensive and helpful, and there are more instructions on the computer desktop in the room. the neighborhood felt a little sketchy at night, but it's a convenient location. i can't imagine getting anything better at this price in dc - definitely recommended! "
32584,3295877,2013-01-07,3353552,Jenny,"the listing details, amenities, & photos are very accurate.  my kids & i spent four days in the carriage house.  the remuzzis are professionals who gave us detailed check in procedures as well as recommendations on parking, eating, & sightseeing.  everything is very organized.  

we had a small problem with the plumbing but after one phone call, one of the very nice brothers came to the residence that night to fix the problem.  it was that easy.  i felt that with three brothers, we would be well taken care of.

check out was easy and straightforward.  will definitely stay again if visiting d.c. again.  thank you to our hosts for a stress-free stay."

32584,3391333,2013-01-22,4114931,Michael,"we visited  washington from massachusetts with our two kids for the 2013 inauguration. we could not have asked for a better place or experience than the carriage house. and for a relatively low price (everyone else had jacked up their prices for this special weekend -but not here)!

we were not very familiar with the neighborhood, but it is actually terrific.
nice vibe, not too gentrified. and lots to walk to, including u street, which has some terrific restaurants and bars. the howard-shaw metro station is very close, making it easy for us to get around. another nice benefit is that the carriage house comes with a parking permit. so we parked our car and used metro after that (a hotel would have charged for parking).

the carriage house was very clean, bright and met our needs. we even stored some food in the refrigerator for late night snacking. 

there is a nice mediterranean restaurant across the street. we had excellent lunches there two separate times. it's a casual place, and the owner is very friendly. 

all of our interactions with the remuzzi brothers was very pleasant, and questions were answered promptly. they were very accomodating to the few special requests we had.

we will definitely stay again. a great experience all around."
32584,3446815,2013-01-31,506687,Grace,"the location was great, especially for the local conference centers.  it's comfortable, easy public transit, great food nearby and it was nice to have laundry; one less thing to worry about after returning home.

the remuzzi's were very communicative and had lots of great tips for the area.  "
32584,3473446,2013-02-04,2776742,Christy,our stay at the carriage house was nice.  it was very comfortable and a short walk to the subway.  the weather was terrible during our stay.  it was downpouring the night we arrived and a slow drip started in the skylight.  it was containable and stopped  dripping when the rain went from drenching to drizzle.  the rest of our stay was extremely cold weather outside and the furnace was great but wasn't keeping up towards the end of our trip.the remuzzi brothers were extremely responsive and took care of it - said it may have been a filter replacement issue.  these problems were pretty slight and overall the experience was pleasant.  i would stay here again despite the minor inconveniences. it was quite cozy.
32584,3526324,2013-02-12,149323,Lori,so great to be just a couple blocks from the metro station -- and check out the nearby african american civil war museum.  fascinating history in the shaw and u street neighborhood. 
32584,3540639,2013-02-14,4279939,Suzanne,"lovely room very clean and safe.  within a block of shaw/howard university metro which is very handy!  everything was in order, and the hosts were very accommodating and easy to work with.  will come back here for sure.  if you are looking for a nice, quiet place to use as a base for either a work or vacation visit i would highly recommend this with one caveat, if you have trouble carrying luggage up stairs you may have a little trouble here.  my friend and i are in our 60's and carrying the luggage up to the room was a bit of a challenge, but we were able to complete the task.  

the only negative from my point of view is the bed was hard.  i prefer a bit softer mattress but if you like hard a hard mattress you would not have a bit of problem.  "

32584,3759987,2013-03-12,2809458,Terri,the remuzzi brothers' carriage house was a perfect place for us (a west coast couple in our late 50's) to stay for our long weekend in washington dc.  we flew in to reagan airport and it was so simple and quick to navigate the metro to the rental. the instructions we were given were spot on and there was no difficulty whatsoever checking in or out. the neighborhood felt safe and the location provided every amenity within close walking distance. using the metro and bike share was such a great experience for us! i will recommend this place to my family and friends going to dc. in the future. 
32584,3788133,2013-03-15,4793277,Shannon,"the carriage house was nice and the brothers were very accommodating. it felt very safe and was only two blocks from the metro. the only issue we had was that the parking pass was missing but the brothers immediately took care of it. they give a very detailed check-in sheet which is also very helpful.

i would definitely recommend! "

32584,3845608,2013-03-20,4975258,Leslie,"2 of us stayed at the carriage house. the room is great. bed and futon sofa were very comfortable. thermostat let us control the temperature. room also includes electric tea kettle, plates and silverware, small fridge, microwave, hair dryer. plush towels. we only had 2 small issues: parking pass was not in room when we arrived and lock on gate broke with us on the inside. in both cases, the remuzzi brothers quickly responded to our phone calls. very impressed with how responsive they were. only 2 blocks from metro. did not eat in any restaurants, so i cannot comment on those. thanks for a great stay! i will certainly stay there again. (p.s. there is no network tv. the monitor on the wall displays whatever xfinity streams. i could not find abc, cbs, nbc. video stalls a lot due to bandwidth. the wifi works great.)"
32584,3859922,2013-03-22,4460479,Ildar,"cool design! really clean and comfort room! great welcome explanation how to arrive! wash machine and dry machine as a big plus for whom who have long trip! thanks, brothers! "
32584,3886193,2013-03-25,413629,Amanda,"we stayed at the carriage house march 21-24.  i inquired about a toaster before arriving and there was one there for me.   it was no more than an eight minute walk from the subway including waiting for crosswalk traffic signals.  there is a 7-eleven between the subway and the house so it was very convenient to stop for snacks.  

the house was clean and we loved all the skylights.  i discovered the security cameras when trying to figure out how to use the tv.  there were 3 of them that were angled at the alley.  it was nice to know that we could just check the tv if we heard something going on late at night.   we checked them for fun a few times and there was never anything happening.  we made use of the microwave and the coffee maker.  we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again."
32584,3957469,2013-03-31,267290,Larry,"while overall we were very pleased with our stay, we do want to point out one unusual guest expectation--guests are asked to do some of their own clean up prior to leaving (strip the bed, put linens and dirty towels by the washer, gather up dirty dishes, take out the garbage).  seems odd that guests are asked to do this cleaning and housekeeping chore.

moving to the positive side.  the directions for getting to and into the carriage house were clear and descriptive - thanks for the images.  having a clothes washer and dryer to use was an added bonus especially since we stayed for 5 nights.  they had a list of suggested restaurants that was helpful.  we ate at two of the places and would certainly go back because of tasty food that was moderately priced and close by--a good value.  the space was roomy and the colors were soothing.  skylights are a great addition to the space.  since the carriage house is behind the main row house you'll hear lots of quiet.  throughout the entire process from booking to questions during our stay trb were quick to respond.  the location near the convention center was a good fit. "
32584,4049358,2013-04-06,2706577,Jess,"we were extremely comfortable in the carriage house during our dc spring break. the location is ideal, on the green and yellow lines, just a few blocks from the shaw-howard metro stop. there was plenty of room for our family (two adults, one teenage boy). having laundry facilities on-site was invaluable, and we really appreciated the mini-fridge for storing left-overs and breakfast fixings. the location was private and secure. i would be hard-pressed to think of a better homebase for our dc exploration. "
32584,4071901,2013-04-08,3289786,Seonghee,"it was so nice and comfortable 2nd house.
the host was so kind and helpful.
the subway so close to carrige house."
32584,4144005,2013-04-14,4060764,Lori,"the carriage house was a great choice for us during our dc vacation.  the short walk to the metro was so convenient.  returning to the peaceful quiet and comfort of carriage house each evening was a real treat for our tired bodies.  we arrived on a hot day and the air conditioning kept the room very cool.

the remuzzi brothers were very good communicators and accommodating to all our needs.  they worked with us when our plans changed unexpectedly.
 
as far as transportation, we rented a car and so the parking pass was appreciated.  but, next time we will only use public transportation.  driving and parking in dc is a nightmare.  (visitors note:  the dc bike share is convenient and inexpensive once you understand all the rules and pricing, otherwise it can be very expensive.)

i would recommend staying at the remuzzi brothers' carriage house when in dc."
32584,4202048,2013-04-18,4819260,Marti,my daughter spent 4 days in washington and were very happy with our choice of the carriage house !  very comfortable accommodations.  felt safe with the security.  great location to metro.  parking pass i guess not left by the last guest.  it was handled quickly and there for us when we returned from touring.  would recommend 
32584,4356413,2013-04-30,3504846,Katie,the house is a bit out of the way but close to the metro and bus stops. washer and drier on site were great! 
32584,4401854,2013-05-03,4621840,Linda,"my husband and i have never been to dc and once we figured out the lay of the land, we were very glad to be staying at the carriage house because you could not have asked for a better location.  it also was cozy and comfortable and the remuzzi brothers were great guys to deal with and even made a compensation for a little issue that we had which we did not expect.   the metro is the way to go in dc to get from here to there and we were about a 1 block walk away from the station and it was so convenient.  we soon learned after getting into town that parking can be difficult but they provided a parking pass which definitely made our life easier.   we only drove our car one day because it had to be off the street for a couple hours one morning.   but we pretty much walked to where we wanted to go and it was just a great place to stay and the price was definitely right.   i would recommend it to anyone traveling to dc.  thank you remuzzi brothers!  
linda and bob"
32584,4470625,2013-05-07,5039110,Josh,"the remuzzi brothers were great. they communicated often enough to feel like you could ask them about anything you needed but not so much that it was annoying.

we loved being able to stay close to a subway and be able to quickly get to all of the sights we wanted to see in dc. it's a great place to stay, especially if you'd rather spend your money on entertainment then on a place to stay. i'd recommend the place to a friend."
32584,4527426,2013-05-11,4284487,Scott,"my girlfriend and i spent three nights at the carriage house and didn't want to leave! the location and ease of metro access couldn't be beat. and the remuzzis have thought of everything when it comes to staying there. an awesome experience, and definitely will top my list the next time i go back to dc."
32584,4633602,2013-05-17,1102994,Michelle,"this place was great. even closer to the metro then we anticipated! clean, bright and airy. they are pros, giving you a lot of detail about the area, where to eat, take out, how to get places etc. their detailed directions were very helpful in finding the place. the only possible negative of this place is how bright it gets when the sun rises in the early morning! its hard to sleep through. but otherwise, this place is amazing. i would absolutely recommend it to a friend."
32584,4931953,2013-06-03,80185,Pablo,"this is a good place. it was clean and comfortable, if somewhat quirky in a converted garage. i appreciated the convenient location a block away from the shaw-howard metro station. it seemed a possibly dodgy neighborhood, but i didn't have any problems. i arrived late at night, but didn't have any problems getting in, the instructions were very clear and made everything easy. i'd stay there again."
32584,5047420,2013-06-10,4384453,Kathie,the carriage house is conveniently located near a metro stop and busses going down to the capital.  we found everything as described and enjoyed our week there.
32584,5113965,2013-06-13,5660162,Joy,"great studio in very convenient area. spacious and light and very clean. lots of useful information. be sure to eat and drink north west of the apt - very lively area, packed with bars. would recommend anyone to stay here."
32584,5161686,2013-06-16,5277579,Adam,"the carriage house was great and the remuzzi brothers were great hosts!  staying there was like having our own studio apartment in the city for a fraction of the cost... and with landlords who were very responsive!

i'd recommend it to anyone, but get your reservations in early - if i ever come back to dc i will be staying here again ;-)"
32584,5271128,2013-06-22,4015174,Daniel,"this is a great place to stay for seeing the sights in dc.  from the metro stop it was easy to find and very comfy.  plenty of room for my two kids and i to just hang out and rest up.  the first day we walked downtown and rented biked for our stay.  bike and roll has a great weekdays where bikes are $15 for adult, $10 kids with a 4 day minimum.  a great deal as you can really see everything you want to and all the things you would miss if driving, budding, or using the metro.  biking the monuments at night is great.  
  back to the carriage house, the internet is good, guest info is nice to have.  the coffee is folgers or costco, and the tea is lipton so if your not ok with that bring your own.  laundry is convenient.  i wish there was more breakfast options with things like pancakes waffles but most only have sandwiches and pastry.  lincoln waffles on 10th is great.
    for anyone afraid of the neighborhood don't be.  everyone we saw or met on the street was very friendly, the little kids loved to see us riding by on biked, one little girl even shared her imaginary donuts with us.  dc is a very diverse and friendly city.  everyone was so nice and i wish i lived is such a diverse and friendly place.    "
32584,5360350,2013-06-26,5349311,Lindsey,"we had a very nice two-day stay at the carriage house in late june.  just like others have said, the remuzzi brothers did a great job of making everything with checking in and getting around as easy as possible.  the washer/dryer were a huge help for us, as was the parking pass.  we had no problem finding a place to park right in front of the building.  the location is great with the metro stop just a quick walk from the apartment.  we would come back here again should we ever need some place to stay in washington d.c.  much better than staying at a hotel.  "
32584,5408446,2013-06-29,1295671,Talitha,"we had a really pleasant stay here. it's close to a metro station, and to bus routes, and a taxi from the national mall only set us back about $10. the ac works really well, which was a nice respite from the dc humidity! there are heaps of guides and leaflets in the apartment to help you pick where to visit as well!"
32584,5481294,2013-07-02,4621178,Steve,"we had a great stay at the carriage house, the place was really nice and in a great location. the parkings pass was a definate plus and we found parking right outside on the street. easy access to downtown with the metro station just around the corner. the accommodation was nice and clean and had everything that we needed. would definately recommend to friends and family. "
32584,5821775,2013-07-18,4842338,Curtis,"this is the way to do dc! my wife and i stayed there while she attended a conference at the convention center.  everything was set up as described and the remuzzi's were super attentive. the apartment is located right near metro and there is a 7-11 1 block away as well as a grocery store that is about 1/2 mile away.  the only drawback (if you can call it that) is that closet and fridge space was small for longer stays (i.e., we were there for about a week); but it was convenient to use the washer and dryer so we were able to manage packing. "
32584,5859698,2013-07-20,5385070,Kate,"this apartment is absolutely fantastic! it's spacious, light and airy, quiet and very well equipped. the a/c works really well (much needed as we were there in a heatwave).
we loved the neighbourhood - far enough away from the bustle of downtown but close enough to walk there. the metro is really close, but we didn't actually use it as we walked everywhere. we tried a couple of the local eateries recommended in the remuzzi brothers' information and they were excellent. 
very highly recommended - would definitely go back."
32584,5962543,2013-07-24,5860835,Rosie,we stayed for two nights and the apartment served as a perfect crash pad. it was exactly as it looked in the photos and was close to the subway so we were easily able to get to the main washington sights.
32584,6504756,2013-08-15,4833031,Stephan,"wirklich eine super unterkunft. sauber, topp ausgestattet und der nahverkehr und damit alle sehenswürdigkeiten ist super zu erreichen.

32584,7476873,2013-09-22,4644141,Rennie,"the overall experience in the carriage house was great. it was close to the metro and felt very safe. the remuzzi brothers are very responsive and helpful. parking was no problem, but be sure to note street cleaning days and move your vehicle as needed. also, be sure to note that the apartment is located up fairly steep stairs so if you have a heavy suitcase it has to be carried up.  with that said! i would stay there again!"
32584,7574905,2013-09-25,5763745,Benjamin,"we had a pleasent stay at this flat. its a self check in, check out flat so it was pretty easy going. we only met one of the brothers but he was a really nice guy. the room is quite spacy really clean. the subway is only 3 minutes away by feet. i would always recommend this apartment."

32584,7755601,2013-10-01,702841,Jason And Briana,"the carriage house is a wonderful spot in dc. we were traveling for business and there are 3 factors when choosing a spot. location (to work), parking, and privacy. the neighborhood is great. safe, walkable to awesome restaurants and bar. and close to where we needed to be for work. we never had a problem parking directly out front and the provided guest parking pass is an amazing perk. great savings compared to hotel parking costs. the description of the place is spot on and the provided pdf guide once we got approved was a huge plus. never experienced such detail like that- the remuzzi brothers went above and beyond. also love that the property is basically self serve. it felt like we owned the place. would highly recommend it!"

32584,7958159,2013-10-10,4936098,Trent,"stayed here for three nights and it was a very nice place to stay. the self check-in process was very easy and they give you very detailed instruction beforehand. 
location itself was good, only a very shot walk to the metro station and plenty of places close by to eat. there is a 7/11 just down the road which we found quite handy.  
the apartment itself was very clean and had quite a bit more room than we expected. the bed was comfortable and the a/c worked well. 
the wifi was ok kept dropping out a bit but it didn't really bother us. they provide a computer which is hooked up to the big tv and it also has tv and movies on demand which was great since one day  during the shutdown we were there and it was raining really heavy. 
overall it was a good place to base yourself in dc. "
32584,7999215,2013-10-12,8081347,Gary,"the brothers instructions are the best that i have encountered, the room is very comfortable and as shown in the photos.   public transport is close by, we enjoyed our stay."

32584,8715523,2013-11-13,8970170,Marivic,"truly highly-recommended!!!  make your stay at washington dc unforgettable!!!  awesome place!!!  awesome hosts!!!  our stay at the carriage house of the remuzzi brothers exceeded all our expectations. the remuzzi brothers left no stone unturned in ensuring that the experience of their guests at their carriage house was nothing short of extraordinary. the place was well-appointed and was supplied with all the amenities one would need if one were at home: an air conditioner, heater, ceiling fan, kitchen utensils, a microwave, a refrigerator, ample supply of bathroom needs such as towels, a widescreen tv with tv and movie inputs, and  a desktop computer with internet access.  more than these, the remuzzi brothers provided brochures and publications about tours and things to do while in the dc area.  there was an instance when we had experienced some difficulties in accessing the tv signal... and joseph remuzzi dropped by within minutes to solve the problem (which turned out to be due to problems with the cable provider).  it turned out to be fortuitous as it was such a pleasure and a delight to have met and chatted with joseph!  he is such a warm and truly gracious individual!   the carriage house is also strategically-situated:  there is a 7-11 store nearby, a metro station, bus stations, restaurants which offer delivery and dine-in options, and even a public library...  all just a stone's throw away.  and the neighborhood is quiet and secure.  staying at the carriage house provided us with opportunity to  ""experience""  the dc life as a local would have.  the professionalism and warmth of the remuzzi brothers started even when we had just made our initial communication inquiries. they responded immediately and were very gracious and friendly.  and during our week-long stay, we had stayed in touch with joseph and he would continuously provide us with tips on places to try.  (his ideas and inputs were always spot on!  we truly loved all the restaurants he recommended).  our stay at the carriage house was an experience we would always cherish, as well as the friendships we had established with the remuzzi brothers.  we expressed our sincere appreciation to them before we left... and we told them to advise us if they would ever be in the philippines  ---  so that we could take them out to dinner or something.  now, how often would you do that had you stayed at a hotel instead?  experience washington dc in a way that would make your trip unforgettable in all ways positive:  enjoy the hospitality of the remuzzi brothers at their carriage house. they do care about their guests, as we had the privilege of experiencing firsthand."

32584,9157980,2013-12-10,6534370,Vanessa,"funky little studio in a good position for public transport. the apartment was delightful and was just what we wanted- cosy and warm (first snow of the season ). the instructions given were clear and easy to follow. there  is a fridge, toaster/ kettle and microwave available if you want to of cater (a bit). bonus was the use of the washing machine and dryer.  the only hitch was very patchy internet access, which when it was working, was incredibly slow. the brothers responded immediately to try and remedy the problem though it was not anything they could sort out. so, best have a plan 'b' for that problem, epically if you are paying international roaming rates. overall, we would happily stay there on another visit."

the place was clean and comfortable. we liked that the soap, shampoo were provided through a wall dispenser - very practical.

the place was also very secure - we enjoyed watching the neighbourhood pass by on the cctv cameras.

as some others have mentioned, the wifi is a bit a patchy / spotty, which was a bit annoying but didn't dampen our stay."

54112,173391,2011-01-22,291587,Chris,"i stayed with daryl recently and it was the ideal stay. he was timely and professional to work with. his place had everything needed to feel comfortable; towels, coffee grinder and press, beautiful lighting and a warm heater during this winter season.

the apartment is also very close to dupont circle, a whole foods and lots of restaurants.

i would definitely recommend daryl to others and would return to this apartment on future visits. "
54112,175541,2011-01-28,95741,Gia,daryl is a wonderful host!  the studio is lovely and well-appointed; convenient to the dupont metro and close to a host of great shops and restaurants. i will definitely stay here again on trips to dc.

54112,228433,2011-04-17,326997,Denise,"we loved our stay. this garden level studio apartment is spacious and in a great location!...if you like to walk, you can reach the white house and other main sights by foot or very quickly by metro or taxi. there are also lots of eateries to choose from around the corner from the apartment. 
the apartment itself was immaculate, very nicely decorated and has all the amenities and storage space you need.  
daryl is a very pleasant and welcoming host with in depth knowledge of the area and great recommendations on where to eat and what to see. we would definitely recommend staying here and would personally stay here again."
54112,244257,2011-04-29,413232,Natasha,this is a great space. we stayed here for 3 nights and we weren't disappointed. recently remodeled and within walking distance to dupont circle and tons of places to eat. the metro is within walking distance. walking is something we really enjoy doing when visiting a city so this was a great space for us. thanks for hosting us!
54112,248309,2011-05-02,498262,David,"this space was great! clean, tidy, inviting, accommodating, and friendly. plenty of towels and a guest book full of maps and area tips.

the apt it on a quiet, flower and tree-lined street, in dupont circle, a cool, exciting part of town.  cabs are easy to catch and the metro is only 10 min walk away.  brunch spots and bars within walking distance.

for my first experience using airbnb, i was very pleased.  this was cheaper than a hotel and more relaxing than crashing on my friend’s couch.  daryl made the experience easy and i hope all my future hosts are as great as daryl.  i will be back to dc and hope i can book this space again!

ps: i loved that kitchen with a gas stove!"
54112,293028,2011-06-01,532352,Susan,"we chose daryl's apartment based on three criteria:  location, appearance in the photos, and price. we were not disappointed in any aspect of our choice. first of all, the photos are 100% accurate. the interior is beautifully done and quite spacious offering every amenity including washer and dryer in the unit. the location is ideal on a leafy, quiet street, 5 blocks from the metro and a block away from whole foods and starbucks. we really enjoyed the deck and even had fun meeting daryl's neighbors as we were there for 10 days. i would recommend this apartment to any couple seeking a neighborhood experience over an impersonal hotel. stay."
54112,311003,2011-06-13,462407,David,a great little apartment!! daryl has created a hotel style apartment for an with an airbnb price tag. it is well presented and has everything you need. the apartment is close to the city and in a safe and wonderful neighbourhood. really good food and drink options nearby. thanks for letting us stay darly it was a pleasure
54112,320521,2011-06-18,574451,Darnell,the apartment exceeded my expectations.  daryl was a gracious host as well.

54112,379560,2011-07-18,513898,Alaya,"the place was perfect for my 2 week visit to the capitol.  couldn't have asked for a nicer place.  i quickly called it my home.  great neighborhood, everything is close by within walking distance and cabs are easily found just a half a block away. i reccomend this place very highly.  thank you.  "
54112,442325,2011-08-13,590862,Will,"the room was very clean, daryl was very nice. the location is great - safe neighborhood, close to the fresh market. probably like a good 10 - 12 minute walk to the metro, but a capital bikeshare rack is just around the corner. i would recommend it."
54112,564534,2011-09-25,692927,Fran,"dary is a great host, you can find all the information you need to visit dc there in the aparment, and if you have any problem just mail daryl, and he will fix it.
about the apartment, is like the pictures, well, better than in the pics, daryl has decorated it perfectly, very good location, perfectly clean, and if you like healthty food, one block away you have a great organic market, if i come back to dc, this is my place to stay."
54112,608720,2011-10-08,1135883,Fabrice,"our stay at daryl's apartment was wonderful.
the interior is tastefully furnished and comfortable. it was far better than a lot of fancy hotels i use to stay.
we enjoyed the patio every morning for breakfast (brunch...) as it was sunny.
location is also great. 8 blocks to national mall is only 15min walk. dupont circle and metro station is at 10min. whole food and starbucks at 1 block. i could go for groceries every morning."
54112,652122,2011-10-22,409988,Eric,"the apartment is just as advertised: quiet, beautifully well-kept, and in a great location that is close to public transportation and shopping.  daryl was a great host and was unobtrusive as well as very responsive (we had an internet connectivity problem that he quickly addressed).  this was our first airbnb experience and a great one; thanks daryl!"
54112,671034,2011-10-28,1126993,Kevin,"i spent 4 days here with my wife while on business. great location in a safe residential area. you can walk to find basically anything you need... there are plenty of restaurants, a grocery store, etc. the apartment itself is perfect; much more space than a typical hotel room, plus the entire interior has obviously been recently updated/upgraded. the outdoor patio area in front is nice too, if you want to hang out or eat outside and watch the action. if you want a taxi, they're all around too. if i go back to d.c., i will definitely try to stay here again. "
54112,1007492,2012-03-17,1628572,Pablo,"perfect location!!! very good taste in decoration. all was good. we spend 5 days combinating work and pleasure. very good restaurants at walking distance. transport and also the washington bycicle system one block away.

54112,1058968,2012-03-29,637928,Li Theng,excellent place daryl has! it is well furnished with everything you need and it is almost like an ideal home to stay in! better than any hotel. the place is one block away from whole foods and some restaurants and drinking places. i just wish it is nearer to the metro. 
54112,1146960,2012-04-18,1286551,Ellen,i love the logan circle area.  everything is so convenient. daryl's place was perfect for my needs. i would highly recommend a stay.
54112,1168035,2012-04-23,1881409,Henry,"while the place is indeed nice, i was more than surprised that i was to be in the basement. nothing in the pictures nor, more importantly, in the description is there an implication that you are going in fact down a tight brickstairs to the the apartment area underneath. 

no doubt is it well furnished, bed is nice. it gets a bit colder than expected and takes a good while for the heat from the water heater to pump through. and if you're unlucky, within 5min, it gets cold again. not too sure what to do about that.

also no shades on the windows. i'm a light sleeper, so any sudden, bright light, i can easily wake up. door is glass body as well. so, unless you're very secure with yourself, you can be easily seen at the right angle or if they're at the door. just the little things. nice apartment, could have better improvements even if i expected to stay in the basement."
54112,1192069,2012-04-28,2103413,Jack,great location. very nice place in a basement appartment with windows.
54112,1241411,2012-05-07,2153952,Kathryn,"the apartment was just as pictured. while i was a bit surprised by the basement location, there was not a basement feel and i definitely enjoyed lots of natural light.  decor very functional, light & tasteful.  perfect location for visiting my son's work/apartment in the dupont circle area. quiet street with lots of lovely brownstones and gardens. plenty of nearby restaurants, groceries, and businesses with a local feel.  distance to dupont metro very walkable.  realtor was very open to calls/emails. only wish i had known about this when my daughter was a student at local university.  makes d.c. feel like home!"
54112,1276125,2012-05-14,1704918,Helena,"this is a great location, with very comfortable amenities. daryl was very helpful in letting me in earlier than checkin time, also putting all the must-know information on a folder inside the apartment.

it is a bit cold inside, because it is underground, underneath the pretty house you see on the picture. but it is very clean, very comfortable. nice kitchen, a very soft bed, nice place to work and reliable internet connection. i couldn't really work out how to turn on the heat, but it wasn't all that necessary in may.

i would just like the shower to be easier to regulate, i struggled with it a bit. still, i would highly recommend this place to all people staying in dc. easy to talk to the host, comfortable, great location, very clean."
54112,1315371,2012-05-21,1994082,Barbara,"stayed for 4 nights in mid-may; lovely studio apartment in great location - right off 14th street and close enough to walk to the metro. very well kept, sunny and airy. there's a whole foods store within walking distance, and the apartment comes with cloth tote-bags, so you can stock the fridge. "
54112,1366399,2012-05-28,1147515,Tina,"daryl was a great host, very responsive. we only saw each other in person for a few minutes. he didn't really need to but it was nice of him to pop in. the apartment was very comfortable and nicely decorated. the bed was also very comfy which made it easy to rest after a long day of travel. and the black-out shades helped me sleep in too. the kitchen was also nicely appointed so made it easy for preparing light meals in, when you just don't want to eat out all the time, with markets and nice restaurants nearby you have your choice. i also took advantage of the warm nights and the lovely garden out front. the tree-lined street was a nice backdrop for peaceful balmy evenings and a glass of cool white wine. i would highly recommend this place and daryl as a host."
54112,1484602,2012-06-15,2102841,Glicia,"the pictures are exactly the place.i really enjoyed to stay at daryl's property.his very kind ,nice e always trying to help us.i stayed there almost 3 weeks and recommend the experience!his neighbors are so cute always inviting to drink margueritas!"

54112,2418524,2012-09-26,2787282,Mark,"my wife and i had a lovely stay at daryl's apartment at the end of a rather tiring and active holiday. the apartment was very comfortable, very quiet and very clean, all appreciated by us. it is in a very nice street and as a bonus there is a whole foods supermarket, a pharmacy and several good bars and restaurants only 2 streets away in p st. everything worked, the kitchen is very well equipped and the bed comfortable and the wifi excellent. daryl was very good about allowing a late checkout for us because we had a late afternoon flight out of washington on our way back to australia. we would have no hesitation in recommending this apartment for a washington stay and would stay again ourselves. the other really, really useful thing we discovered was the capital bikeshare scheme, with a station again on p st and 15th, which we used exclusively for transport aroud washington for 3 days for the total cost of $15 each. with many bike stations around town and an online and phone app to tell you whether bikes and docking places are available or not, it proved to be a real value add and fun addition to our stay. "
54112,2627806,2012-10-16,2657934,Sue,"great area - quiet, clean, safe, beautiful domestic architecture and streetscapes, close to public transport, excellent food shopping with wholefoods and sweet greens a couple of minutes walk away, and plenty of eating places to choose from.

the apartment was beautiful, modern, clean, excellently set up and perfect for 2 people.  daryl was an excellent and accommodating host and we absolutely loved our stay in dc.

54112,2858089,2012-11-11,519083,Clare,"safe, quiet, and spotlessly clean. this is a basement apartment in a lovely house on a tree-lined block. daryl is polite and thoughtful. it's right around the corner from a supermarket, starbucks, dry cleaners, etc, in one direction, and the best coffee in washington in the other (peregrine cafe). i hope i can stay here again when i'm in washington.

the neighborhood is excellent.  safe and pretty.  there was a whole  foods, cvs and plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance.  bus lines, the metro and capital bikeshare were all close.  i even walked to the white house in about 15 minutes.

54112,7327836,2013-09-16,7373369,Sarah,"daryl  was a lovely host and responded quickly to all queries.  there was also some helpful info in the apartment.  the apartment was perfect for me and my husband on our 10 day stay in dc.  it is a garden/basement apartment but is still very light.  it was also quite cool which meant that we did not need to use the air conditioning too much even on the warmest days (september not the height of summer).  the apartment was very well stocked with everything you need: crockery, glassware, towels, bed linen, washing machine and drier etc.  it is in a great location - we felt very comfortable walking around the area - for losts of good bars and restaurants on p street and 14th street.  also walking distance to metro (four blocks), the white house and all the main attractions on the mall.  we'd definitely recommend staying at daryl's place."
54112,7569038,2013-09-24,608092,Jack And Jerrod,"excellent place, just as in pics. clean, neat, excellent location. i will be back! daryl is very responsive and helpful."
54112,7655102,2013-09-28,8829811,Lahaina Mae,"great space, great location, and great host.

i contacted daryl only about a week before i wanted to rent his place. i'm a dc resident with work  being done to my home, so i needed a place to stay for a week. there was another renter scheduled to check in the same day i wanted to check out. daryl coordinated and tried his best to book a cleaning service in  between, but with no avail. instead of just saying he couldn't accommodate me, he trusted me to have my own cleaning lady clean his place before the next renter. as you can see, daryl is a very accommodating host who was very hospitable and responsive the whole time.

as for the apartment, it was beautiful. it was very clean, with more enough space for a single or couple. it's fully equipped with a washer, dryer, wifi access, dish washer, and even a welcome guide that daryl put together with all the information you need to know about the apartment, the neighborhood, and visiting dc for the tourists. this space was definitely a great deal! i would definitely considering staying here again and i have already been recommending the place to friends and family."
54112,7791429,2013-10-03,7788923,Anthony,"a fantastic apartment in a fantastic location with a fantastic landlord.

i stayed here for five days, and while i didn't get to meet daryl, it was a snap to get in and out of the apartment, and the location is second to none for the bars and restaurants on 14th street, or the places in dupont or down town, which are an easy walk. "
54112,7971518,2013-10-10,354067,Felicity,"daryl was very helpful.  i arrived from the west coast at 2am and he made it very easy for me to get access to the apartment and get settled in.  the apartment itself was perfect.  the accommodations were lovely, the bed comfy and every details thought of down to the hairdryer in the bathroom.

this trip was business travel for me but since i am on the road a lot i work hard to try and make my life on the road feel like home and this was the perfect location for that.  everything i could want or need was within a few short blocks including bike share, wholefoods, great restaurants and the metro. 

big thanks to daryl for making life a little sweeter for this road warrior and looking forward to staying there again on my next trip to dc."

54112,8665091,2013-11-11,9520975,Moria,"we (my husband and i) stayed in daryl's apartment for 5 days, and enjoied every minute of it! the location and ammeneties are as good as described in the airbnb site. what you don't see on the site is the attention to details, all those little things that turn a rental apartment into your home away from home. excellent experience, and if we'll return to dc, we sure will try to return to deryl's place."
54112,9092379,2013-12-06,9818040,Jill,daryl's apartment was great. i am a d.c. resident and needed a place to stay for a few days while work was being done in my apartment. his place is very clean and very well-lit for a basement space. great location too if you are visiting d.c.!
54112,9250380,2013-12-16,249031,Tim,"fantastic! second time i've stayed at daryl's place and it is perfect. each time, i stayed for a week, had to work nearby. the place is immaculate, modern, close to whole foods and wonderful restaurants, easy access to metro bus and few blocks from dupont circle metro. very comfortable, can't say enough good things about this great studio. daryl is super responsive and helpful too. do it!"
62119,151016,2010-12-08,172204,Bernard,"i had a wonderful stay a delightful stay at sarah's house.  she and her husband are wonderful hosts.  their large spacious house overlooks rock creek park, a world away from the bustle of the city, and yet barely five minutes from the nearby metro stop.  the room was nice and warm, the breakfast plentiful, and i was able to use the dining room table (with a great view over the park) to work for many hours.  there is an abundance of interesting, yet moderately priced restaurants around the metro station, from where you can reach downtown in less than 10 minutes.  i greatly recommend it, and look forward to returning."
62119,153324,2010-12-13,105927,Dan,"i had a very enjoyable time as a guest of sarah and her husband. they and their teenage son were friendly, wonderfull, and hospitable hosts and the room was absolutely perfect. the neighborhood, as bernard mentioned, is home to several quality restaurants and shops, and is convenient to the metro and several other areas and sections of d.c. well worth visiting and exploring. i couldn't offer a higher recommendation and am looking forward to again being a guest the next time i'm in town."
62119,167468,2011-01-07,296355,Jeremy,"highly recommended

sarah and her family were perfect hosts to me and made my trip to dc play out like a fairytale. because of them, i actually wished i could spend more time in dc!

as a stranger into washington dc and taking the metro to the adams morgan at night, i found that the area is indeed a more upclass/wealthy area - so i felt very safe navigating my way around. i was so fascinated looking at all the beautiful big houses as i made my way to sarah's house. 

upon reaching, i was greeted with a beautiful typically american house with a nice big christmas tree and piano in the living room. the house is warm and cosy. best of all, it was filled with a lot of great artwork which at first i thought were bought, but turns out were created by their children! so awesome to be surrounded by art throughout the whole house. 

brought up to my room, it is very clean and even smells of fantastic, relaxing sandalwood incense. they ensured i had enough blankets and fresh towels. the bed is very comfortable and the room overlooks the park just beside the house - imagine the serenity!

i found sarah and her husband jim to be very intellectual, well-read and yet, extremely down-to-earth and easy to talk to. we have many good socio-political discussions about different countries, and they gave me a very good idea of what makes dc ticks (everything revolves around politics), how ppl live there, which areas to avoid, etc. even their teenage son is very friendly - we had a few good chats too. they always asked me about my day and suggested great places that i should visit. 

in the mornings, they always offered me breakfasts and asked me to help myself to coffee tea juices etc. 

sarah and jim were also very respectful of privacy. for example, one night i came back and saw a fresh towel placed outside my room's door. 

as for the location for the house, i've mentioned that it is just beside a park. it is only a bit more than 5 mins' walk to the nearest metro station. from there, it is only a couple of stops (less than 10 mins) to reach downtown dc where all the museums, galleries and monuments are. extremely convenient. the house is also 10 mins' walk away from the adams morgan area where there are a few good pubs and lounges. as suggested by jim, i had dinner at madam's organ which had amazing food and live blues band at 9.30pm - an experience not to be missed. 

in all, sarah and jim were very hospitable, accommodating, considerate and helpful. i would definitely contact them if i ever visit dc again.  

thanks sarah and jim tom!"

62119,270805,2011-05-19,507522,Theodore  (Ted),first experience with airbnb   i like b&bs  but staying in a hotel in dc by myself was not appealing.  i attended a 3 day meeting at the convention center.  the location was perfect next to a greenbelt.  the hosts were very engaging and helpful.  wifi.  great value!  i would do it again.
62119,288672,2011-05-30,531739,Philippe,"i had good conversations and overall a great time with jim tom (sarah was away travelling). i completely felt at home. additionally, the location is spectacular, pretty much right in the center of town and at the same time the house is surrounded by trees. i absolutely recommend this place."
62119,296133,2011-06-03,118351,Frédéric,"i had a great stay at sarah's house. the house is well located in a residential area, overviewing the forest of rock creek park, 2 blocks from 18th street's bars and restaurants, at walking distance from dupont circle, 10/15 minutes from downtown by metro. 
i had interesting chats with her husband and played great ping pong games with her son. "
62119,310272,2011-06-12,654639,David,"sarah and her husband were warm, welcoming, thoughtful, friendly and helpful hosts.  if i am ever looking to stay in that area again, i would certainly see if i could stay with them.  the wall of books in the bedroom was great fun to peruse :-)"
62119,321261,2011-06-18,128757,Andrei," i had an excellent time staying with sarah. the room was comfortable and well-appointed, and sarah and jim tom definitely went out of their way to make my stay pleasant. their home is situated in a great neighborhood and walking distance from red line metro and adams morgan area where there are a few good coffee shops and pubs. i would definitely recommend tryst with live music and jazz bands on wednesday and thursday nights. great place, and a great time. i will definitely stay again. thanks sarah and jim tom."
62119,332335,2011-06-24,457162,Jessica,"sarah's house is very centrally located.  it is a comfy little residence nestled into quiet corner near the river.  i love the neighborhood and home!  sarah was very helpful and while i had trouble booking the place, she worked through the problems with me to get my last minute reservation into the system.  she was very welcoming and helpful while i was there.  "
62119,336983,2011-06-27,105927,Dan,"had a great stay as always! d.c. is starting to feel like a second home, thanks in large part to sarah, jim tom, and their son's hospitality."
62119,352843,2011-07-04,757595,Edwin,"a super lovely house right on rock creek park.  they allowed us to bring our dogs at no extra charge, which was a real plus.  also offered coffee or tea in the a.m., so it was like staying with friends."
62119,370967,2011-07-13,93277,Marnie,"good value for a charm-filled, huge old rambling house in a great neighborhood with a friendly family.  quiet and right next to a nice leafy park.  about 10 minutes to the woodley-park/zoo metro, and 10 minutes in the other direction gets you to bustling adams morgan with great cafes/bars/restaurants.  have breakfast at tryst café, you can enjoy free wireless internet there (but not on weekends) or great signal at the nearby starbucks.  also a good kinko's/fedex business center for any business needs.  the house has great wireless too!  just not in your room."
62119,375992,2011-07-16,686390,Benjamin,"i had a wonderful time staying with sarah and her family. great basic accommodations in charming home. everyone in the family was very generous and a pleasure to get to know. thanks for having me, and i'll look forward to having a place to stay in dc if i have a chance to visit the city again. "
62119,388850,2011-07-22,612820,Angela,"although sarah was out of town helping her godmother write her memoirs, her lovely son true and husband jt were perfect hosts and gentlemen.  the house is beautiful and filled with art, the room comfortable and spacious, clean, and overlooking the beautiful rock creek park.  it is a short walk to the eclectic adams morgan neighborhood and to public transportation.  i would stay here again in a heart beat and fully intend to if they will have me!"
62119,398771,2011-07-26,165357,Theodore,"my stay with sarah, jim, and their son was great.  they were very accommodating and friendly.  the house was nice and roomy.  i easily found space to get some work done on my laptop while i was there.  the room looks out over a wooded park.

the neighborhood was beautiful and close to a great coffee shop.  the metro and bus stops were a short walk.  there is a even a local dock for washington's bike share program that i was able to use.  

i highly recommend their place.  it will definitely be my first choice next time i am in dc.   thanks guys!"
62119,625990,2011-10-13,1147106,Maria (Ani Choetso),"i had a wonderful stay at sarah's place. she and jim were wonderfully hospitable, offering helpful information (and a map!) of the area. the place is just a few minutes' walk from a bevy of restaurants on 18th street, and minutes from the adams morgan woodley park metro on connecticut avenue. the view from my room was of the beautiful woods of the park. the house is quiet with no traffic noise. accommodations were clean and comfy, morning coffee was offered, and i hope to stay here again for sure; what a sanctuary! an incredible value in a fantastic part of dc.  "
62119,633458,2011-10-16,407029,Hans,"i had a wonderful time at sarah's house. the accommodations are perfect and comfortable, the location couldn't be better just a few blocks from 2 metro stations. but what made my stay  an unforgettable experience was the time i shared with sarah and jim tom. i'll look forward to staying again at their place and continue the conversation."
62119,644921,2011-10-19,1112679,Keitlyn,"sarah was an excellent host for my mom when she came to visit. she went above and beyond to make my mom feel at home, even leaving her some sparkling wine for her birthday!! thank you!"
62119,659565,2011-10-24,1257244,Mark,"sarah and her family are very hospitable, know the area, and are fun. bustling household very welcoming. house is big enough that privacy available in room or front parlor. big, sweet, fluffy dog. shared bath, single bed, outstanding view into rock creek park at clavert; side yard is the park, with dog-walkers, birding (i saw a screech owl and heard a barred owl), and hiking. vibrant neighborhood but quiet street; a good combination.  wifi and kitchen work; off-street parking. i recommend."
62119,688958,2011-11-03,561988,Kala,"very convenient location--a few blocks to bus and metros, very lively neighborhood with lots of entertainment yet the home was an elegant house in the quiet leafy end of a street overlooking rock creek park.  best of all worlds. sarah and jim thom are wonderful, interesting people.   "
62119,698955,2011-11-07,780314,Curtis,"beautiful room - arrived in the dark and next morning was amazed to look out the window and see the colors of fall - the window looks out on the green area of rock creek park. 

the family is very nice and if i am back again in dc, hope the place is free."
62119,712016,2011-11-12,1179872,Armen,"i enjoyed staying in sarah's home, sarah and jim are very nice and supportive people. the location is very convenient, i was surprised that instead of taking metro i can walk in the morning to the dupont circle (about 20 minutes walking distance from the hill). i have no doubt to stay at the same place on my next visits to dc."
62119,775941,2011-12-11,844125,Mark,"i spent four weeks at sarah and jim tom's and it was a wonderful experience. the room is light, clean and comfortable and they let you use the living room and kitchen at your pleasure. but, most importantly, they are extremely gracious hosts who make you feel welcome and at ease in their home."
62119,880377,2012-01-24,30797,Giovanna,"staying at sarah's was like staying at your long-distance uncles you love but you just don't see that often. i felt right at home. sarah and jt are super welcoming, warm, and willing to assist on on anything. i thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. i used to live in dc some time ago, so i was already familiarized with the area... the location is unbeatable... right on the heart of adams/dupont/woodley park area... you can basically walk to any of those places easily. the metro is 5 minutes away, there's also a bus stop a block away... tryst (the best coffee shop in town) is few blocks away. there are stores and restaurants around the area... very, very convenient. would definitely stay there again."
62119,894988,2012-01-31,1642182,Janelle,this is a wonderful space with easy in and out to meet scheduling needs and close access to the metro. very good value for the cost.
62119,1037600,2012-03-24,1875710,Hannah,"this was my first airbnb stay, so i don't have much basis for comparison, but i was thrilled with my experience. sarah has a lovely, large house in a beautiful neighbourhood. in one direction it's a 5-10 minute walk to the metro, in the other about a 5 minute walk to the main adam morgans road with coffee shops, bars and restaurants. it took about 20-25 minutes to get downtown. the room was light and spacious, the bed was comfortable and the house was quiet and laid back.  and there was internet! i've stayed in a few hotels in dc and i thought sarah's was exceptional value for one of the best stays i've had.  "
62119,1046699,2012-03-26,480758,Navid,"sarah and jim tom were extremely welcoming hosts and an absolute delight to talk with and get to know. their house is gorgeous, huge, full of windows and natural light and on the edge of a beautiful park. the room was perfect, wifi was great and reliable, and their location is amazing. only about a 5-minute walk to the subway, and lots to eat and do in the adams morgan area. i walked to/from dupont circle from their house many times and it took no time at all. amazing deal for such wonderful people and great location. will definitely stay here on future visits to dc."
62119,1187118,2012-04-27,1369524,Jiesheng,"it was a lovely household, everything one could ask for (especially staying over a long period of time) and a scenic and quiet neighbourhood. i highly recommend a stay at sarah's."
62119,1217884,2012-05-02,2121575,Anastasia,staying at sarah's was great. both she and her husband are very hospitable and accommodating. the house is located in a fantastic neighborhood - a 5 minute walk to the adams morgan metro and a 15 minute walk to dupont circle. i would highly recommend staying with sarah and jt to anyone. 
62119,1272107,2012-05-13,2163457,Alberto,excellent house and hosts. it's a must in dc!

their house is ideally located--close to dupont circle, adams morgan, rock creek park, et al. and both the metro and buses are easily accessible. 

highly recommended!"
62119,1589477,2012-06-29,261805,Tony,"i spent a week with sarah and jim tom and will be staying with them again soon.  the house is beautiful as is the setting.  it's like being in the woods, even though you're right in town. i enjoyed chatting with both of them and their sons. my room was very comfortable and clean."
62119,1649721,2012-07-07,2327316,Jenny,"i had a wonderful stay! this was my first airbnb experience and everything was smooth sailing from start to finish.  i found the room very comfortable. sarah and her family were wonderful, we spent some time chatting and watching tv over a glass of wine some of the evenings during my stay.  i was able to walk (easily) to many shops and restaurants. the metro access is very easy as well.very nice neighborhood, and safe for walking.  i was in town for a conference but this stay felt more like a vacation! sarah and her family made me feel at ease and comfortable during my entire stay. i highly recommend sarah's place. "
62119,1759277,2012-07-21,1606352,Yannick,"for my first airbnb experience, staying with sarah and her family was the best introduction! i immediately felt comfortable and really enjoyed chatting about everything (from what to do and see in dc to politics!) with sarah  and jim tom. the dog is the most friendly one you can imagine, he didn't bark one single time, even when i let myself into the house!
being close to the metro, bus lines and bikeshare stations (i definitely recommend using bikes in dc!), the location of the house is superb! what's more, adams morgan is a vibrant, diverse and unique neighborhood, the best spot being tryst, a café that feels like an extension of your own house, exactly like staying with sarah and jim tom that i thank very much for their hospitality and wish to see again soon."
62119,2160546,2012-09-01,2137101,Tom,"i couldn't have asked for a nicer stay in washington d.c. the room was comfortable, the house beautiful and well-located, and sarah and jim excellent hosts. dupont circle is an easy walk and woodley metro is even closer; sarah and jim were full of good recommendations in the neighbourhood; and with the park right next door it's easy to forget you're in the middle of a major world capital. i certainly hope to stay here again next time i'm in town."
62119,2461407,2012-10-01,855994,Veronique,"it was a real pleasure staying with sarah and jim tom. the house was beautiful, the location both convenient and quiet and it felt like staying with friends of the family. they were very hospitable and made me feel at home immediately. 
i had a wonderful time here and i would go back any time if i could. i stayed for four weeks and it really became my home for that time. "
62119,3043989,2012-12-08,261805,Tony,"it is always a pleasure to stay with sarah.  we had a great conversation one evening about the current political climate. the house is wonderful and i love the area, which not only has great restaurants but is also very close to metro."
62119,3381684,2013-01-21,1628977,David,"i had a really nice stay at their place.  this was my first time using airbnb, and it was very easy and convenient to the conferences i was at just down the street.  they let me come and go as i pleased, and the room i was in was spacious and clean, with everything i needed.  the location is very beautiful, in a very convenient part of adams morgan.  really happy i stayed here, thanks!"
62119,3410692,2013-01-25,261805,Tony,i have stayed with sarah and jim tom for a number of times and will continue to do so. they are quite interesting and i love their beautiful home. they have a keyboard in the living room which i play occasionally. we have had some great conversations. their home is very conveniently located a short walk from adams-morgan and metrorail.
62119,4299741,2013-04-26,5016905,Darlene,"having lived in the washington dc area all my life, and having recently made philadelphia my permanent home, i was so excited to discover airbnb and particularly sarah's home.  her home is in such a nice, safe neighborhood and so accessible to downtown. 

i walked from her home in the morning to my office near the white house in 45 minutes, walking along tree lined streets enjoying the april flowers. the woodley park metro and the dupont circle metro stops are about equal distance away from the house - about a 10 or 15 minute walk.  woodley park, on the west side of the rock creek park, may be a little closer.  both are on the red metro line.  

i enjoyed the room with the twin bed that looked out on rock creek park, facing somewhat west.  next i want to try the other room - the room with the loft bed, which also has a view of the park.  i loved my stay and look forward to many more, because although i love my new home, as a soon-to-be retiree, i must come back to see my long-time friends and enjoy what is unique to washington dc - great theater, restaurants, parks, zoo, etc.."
62119,4846852,2013-05-28,6393549,H Lynn,"what a comfy stay!  my host family and i were on different orbits for much of my visit.  our paths crossed only occasionally - as i was in town for a reunion w a group of friends and much of my time was spent on-the-go.  my room was clean, the accommodations were delightful, and it was everything i needed it to be.  i had good email and text communication with sarah and jim, when needed, and otherwise could not have enjoyed it more!  i'll definitely be calling on them again, when i'm back in the dc area."
62119,6617637,2013-08-19,3587323,Patty,"i had a wonderful stay at the green home.  the house is spacious, gorgeous, and well-located (a short walk to the woodley-park metro, numerous bus lines, adams morgan, and great winding running trails).  the house is in a nice neighborhood, on a quiet tree-lined side-street.  the hosts (sarah and jim) are also very kind, leaving you extra tea, soap, towels, bedding should you require it, and use of the kitchen, which was appreciated.  buddy the dog is sweet and well-behaved and seems to spend most of the day sleeping on the stairwell and sofas.  overall, i wish i could have stayed longer, and truly enjoyed my time there.  thanks green home!"
62119,7486901,2013-09-22,7589840,Pauline,"charming host with a lovely family house. the location is great, within a residential area. it's true that their dog is amazing (quiet and affectionate). did i mention their library? great! sarah and jim tom are very open and helpful about everything.
15 minute-walk to the closest metro station (red line) but the bus station is just around the corner.
thank you, i hope i will come again!"
62119,7839411,2013-10-05,183219,Catherine & Peter,"sarah's house is on a quiet street near a park very close to the metro. i enjoyed the peaceful surroundings, and though i didn't actually meet sarah in person, we had no trouble coordinating details by email ahead of time. (the fact that you don't need a physical key is very useful!) i had a conference at a hotel near her house and it was the perfect spot."
62119,7995993,2013-10-12,6325620,Margaret,"i enjoyed my stay in sarah's home.....a  residence with lots of character in a quiet, leafy street. i appreciated the small fridge and hot water jug to make snacks and drinks.also the large  bookcase in my bedroom. all the family were friendly and courteous.

i loved it.  they have a beautiful house in a great neighborhood.  it's not far from the metro and you're 2-3 stops from the main sights in washington.  great restaurants all around them, taking only 5-10 minutes to walk to them.  the room was great, and they are making it even better.

i will stay with them anytime i come to washington dc again."
62122,2710141,2012-10-24,3695854,Gillian,"fabulous location near woodley park metro, zoo and my most favorite running trail in dc (rock creek park!).  couldn't ask for better hosts and the roof top garden is a piece of amazing solitude and peace in the middle of a very busy city!"

62122,4216659,2013-04-19,116844,Val,"what a special time and great host staying with sarah was! the community is so energetic and diverse. her home is warm and friendly. getting back and forth to the city and places beyond was easy,  mostly meeting sarah and her family was the best part oe f the experience. you'll be lucky to stay here! thank you sarah! c u in cuba"

62122,4804825,2013-05-27,5686043,Thomas,"sarah's house is beautiful and super cozy, as are the street and surrounding neighborhood. the big room -- the one with the loft -- is spacious and has great light coming into it.

sarah herself is warm and accommodating, and she's great both as a host and conversation partner. having gotten to meet her family, they were great too and very down to earth. the short time i was able to spend with them was great, and if i go back to dc, i'll surely stay with them again!

oh, and the walk to the nearby marriott took no time at all, perhaps 10min, which was very convenient since that's where my conference was. if you're going to a conference/convention there, sarah's house is an excellent choice!"
62122,5130532,2013-06-14,5295150,Sarah,"we spent 3 nights here during a recent research trip to dc. great location near the red line in a charming neighborhood. sarah's house has lots of historic character - the loft room is bright and airy. we were pretty busy during our trip so we didn't have too much interaction with the hosts - but they were kind, helpful, and welcoming when we did see them. playing with dog buddy was definitely a highlight. "
62122,5263312,2013-06-21,6630796,Jo,"sarah and jim tom were wonderful hosts. they made my stay in washington dc memorable and welcomed me into their home and their family. my room was comfortable and i felt like i was home from home. i'd love to visit washington dc again and, if i do, i will defintely ask to stay with sarah and jim tom again, and i hope my stay with them will be the start of a lasting friendship x x x"
62122,7448173,2013-09-20,8607225,Naoko,"sarah and jim tom are very kind and friendly.
i felt home right away.
the house is so nice and spacious, the best location in dc.
the dog buddy is awesome dog. the best experience in bnb.

62122,7591417,2013-09-25,8881937,John,sarah's place was the perfect spot to sleep and stroll adams morgan. the bed is in a very comfortable and cool loft. thanks! 
62122,8205782,2013-10-20,5016905,Darlene,the reservation was canceled 26 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.
62122,8897791,2013-11-25,8914639,Nicole,"i had an amazing stay in dc. the house was very close to the hotel that the conference was being held at. it took less than 10 minutes to walk and i felt safe even after dark because of all of the people around. sarah and jim tom were very accommodating and were great about providing anything you needed--towels, extra blankets, coffee, a fridge, microwave, and a water glass. there are many great restaurants in the area and it took less than 15 minutes to get to the monuments by metro. i could easily access the house at all times and had plenty of space in the loft room. i will definitely stay here again when i return to dc!"
67483,178804,2011-02-06,74805,Nathan,"we had a wonderful stay! it's a beautiful house in a quiet neighborhood (columbia heights)that's a short walk from the metro, wonderland ballroom, etc. chris is a great host. he's very friendly and accommodating. it's a great value and we'd stay again. slept 5 comfortably."
67483,186099,2011-02-21,41558,Rajeev,"looks like my last review didn't get posted. 
we had a very pleasant stay in this victorian rustic place, even though its not a completely separate unit we had complete privacy as had complete attic to ourselves. short drive to every thing dc and easy street parking right outside made it easy to come back even during the day. "
67483,215731,2011-04-03,368549,Sarah-Marie,"i visited dc with my boyfriend from germany. chris was very welcoming, when we arrived. the appartment was cozy and clean; we really enjoyed staying there. we also appreciate the ""green"" styl of living.
the next metro station took us conveniently to downtown dc. there is also a giant and a shopping center close to the appartment. 
we also had our privacy and contacted chris about breakfast items we needed by texting or leaving notes (that's why our stay was not very personal).
all in all we really enjoyed staying there!"
67483,255742,2011-05-08,530299,Marci,"the upstairs apartment was charming and comfortable, with lots of little ""extras,"" including fruit and and breakfast foods.  short walk to the col hts metro.  a great experience; i would definitely stay here again."
67483,269418,2011-05-18,497564,Alex,we enjoyed this cozy third floor b&b stocked with yummy organic food. super convenient. 
67483,275947,2011-05-23,408866,George,the charming b & b in columbia heights was nice well kept place. the place was (2) blocks from the metro which ideal for our activities. we were a  block from our sons place which was great.  we were very active so had little interaction with the host but our first meeting was a positive. there is no fancy frills but mate the needs for a reasonable rate. we will use again on future visits to the dc area.  
67483,285000,2011-05-28,561389,Helen And Patrick,"great place, interesting neighbourhood and very conveniently located (quick walk to the train station). we had a comfortable stay and enjoyed hanging out with chris over a beer at one of the local eateries."
67483,323864,2011-06-20,559895,Dee & Neal,"this richly diverse neighborhood is in easy walking distance to two metro stops, making this bnb a good jumping off point for touring d.c.  while the household itself is quiet, some guests may find the nearby intersection a bit noisy at night.  the bnb does offer air conditioning which can mitigate street sounds and is a must on hot nights.  the bedroom is comfortable; though not dark (the paper accordion window blind does little to block the street light outside).  the real gem here is the spacious front porch where guests can kick up sore feet, sip cool drinks in the shade and watch fireflies play in the fig tree or lightning dance in the distance."
67483,331539,2011-06-24,562872,Barbara,"beautiful house with chairs on the verandah. big glass door and up to 2nd floor room on polished wood stairs. very comfortable bed, shower good and fridge and toaster excellent. juice, butter, jam & bread kindly supplied and crockery washed up for us.

easy walk to metro and bus to town - what was offered was exactly what was supplied and very nice too.   "
67483,339799,2011-06-28,523030,Judy,very comfortable and convenient.  
67483,346956,2011-07-01,530299,Marci,"the fig & holly is great.  2nd time staying and just could not be happier.. bed is comfy, apartment is adorable, process for arriving and leaving is trouble-free.  chris was super concerned that temperature was ok given hot dc summer, and i can say it was perfect. ac works fantastic (and quick) when needed!  i love the columbia heights neighborhood; location is great.  overall highly recommended."
67483,365336,2011-07-11,437755,Joy,"pros:  let us check in early when we arrived, great location to the metro, fun and interesting neighborhood.  cons:  requested by host that the ac not go below 72 degrees, which we followed, but came back several times to find it adjusted.  not very fun in the middle of a hot dc day.  host did not seem to get much satisfaction out of running the b&b."
67483,409715,2011-07-31,429467,Joyce,"our stay at chris' fig and holly bnb was very nice.  the loft is on the 3rd floor, and has a nice sized bedroom, a cozy living room/ dining area that is nicely supplied with organic bread, jam, fruit, milk and granola, coffee to freshly grind, coffee maker, microwave and small frig.  the bath is small, but effective and well-planned.  
the bed and sofas were very comfortable and chris was very helpful and responsive to questions we fielded.
the neighborhood is pretty nice, up on a hill and a few miles from downtown, with lots of shopping nearby including a very nice organic grocery a few blocks away (10 minute leisurely walk).
highly recommend.
(note, as it is an attic space, the walls have a slope to them . . . if you are very tall, or somewhat forgetful about the space you occupy, that might be an issue for you but is really only noticable when standing up from one of the sofas placed on one side, so don't let that stop you). "
67483,489256,2011-08-30,1021961,Antonia,"staying at this place was amazing! everything was perfect: chris is such a friendly and helpful host, the apartment is great (rooms are perfect size and very clean) and the breakfast was delicious (especially the fresh fruit and cereal). it's only a short walk to the metro and you're in the city in just a few minutes.

chris did us a huge favor: we were supposed to spend one night in baltimore but it didn't work out so we called him at 10.30pm and it was no problem at all. 

if you want a really nice place to stay and a friendly host you can't ask for something better!"
67483,546413,2011-09-19,52726,Richard,"chris is the ultimate good host.  his green house runs on solar!  what a great corporate citizen.  plenty of parking and close to an amazing mexican restaurant.  stay there!  oh, and his homemade fig jam is amazing."
67483,557473,2011-09-22,473112,Caleb,"we loved staying here. it was great having the breakfast ready in the mini-fridge, coffee, juice, etc. the room felt very private and welcoming. we didn't get to meet chris and glean some beer knowledge, but our other host eric was really kind, thoughtful and had great suggestions for things to do around town. "
67483,562993,2011-09-24,681852,Franziska,"my folks stayed at this b&b during their visit. it is very close to the metro, very clean and my folks liked it very much. "
67483,570558,2011-09-26,1122846,Sarah,very nice home in a great location.  comfortable with a separate sitting area and breakfast in the fridge for us to make ourselves. available street parking generally & completely walkable to the metro and many restaurants nearby.
67483,610544,2011-10-09,822677,Frauke,"we enjoyed our 10 day stay  at chris' fig and holly bnb very much. good location, close to 2 metro stations. it was great having breakfast ready in the mini-fridge (granola, milk, juice, jam, fruit,...) and coffee fresh to grind. the apartment has a lot of space, rooms and bed are very comfortable, shower works just fine. process for arriving and leaving is troublefree and well organized. we would definitvely stay there again. highly recommended. "
67483,636651,2011-10-17,1141756,Zuleyma,"i was not sure what to expect, so was very pleased to find that we had, not only a bedroom, but a suite with a comfortable ""living room"", refrigerator, microwave, dishes, siverware, and a breakfast table. breakfast ingredients were left in the refrigerator.  there was no hot breakfast, but plenty of cereal (fresh granola), bread, milk, orange juice and lots of fruits.  for us this was perfect because we do not usually eat big, hot breakfasts.  we also appreciated the privacy.  chris was very helpful when needed, but in no way intrusive or overly talkative.  we saw him only twice during our three-night stay and that was, again, perfect for us because we value privacy.  we also were very pleased at the ""green"" nature of the b&b (separate recycling, compost, and trash containers).  the suite is on the third floor (nothing else on that floor) and we never heard anything from the rest of the house - so very peaceful.  suite was clean; there is no daily linen or cleaning service but it was not necessary  and we preferred it that way.  a nice touch was that there were games and puzzles in the closet - which made for enjoyable, quiet evenings.  neighborhood was quiet and we walked home from the metro (about 5 blocks away) in the late evenings  and  it seemed quite safe.  location is very central so easy to go almost anywhere in dc fairly easily.  and, if you are not familiar with the dc metro system, never fear - the shower curtain is a huge map of the metro system and all the stops!  overall, we were very pleased and would certainly consider staying there again on our next visit to dc."
67483,706590,2011-11-09,1360527,Shira,great experience. no complaints. chris is a great host. very responsive and respectful. really enjoyed my stay. 
67483,725753,2011-11-17,1010985,Armando,very cozy living space in a great neighborhood with easy access to the metro system. chris is very accessible and easy to communicate with. he offers a very delicious and organic breakfast. greatly enjoyed staying at this beautiful house. 
67483,809590,2011-12-28,1269806,Karen,"very comfortable and convenient accommodations.  it's a great space for two people, with a large sleeping room and a separate living/eating area. chris was helpful and responsive.  we were visiting a family member who lived in the neighborhood and this place was perfect for our needs.  it is a very easy walk to the metro and various bus lines and we easily made our way all over town and felt safe walking back late at night."
67483,927183,2012-02-17,107622,Carol,"the stay was great, chris was great, the location was great. all the photos and reviews tell it all! and he even got rice milk for me to go with the granola! that, and homemade fig jam for toast. 

excellent stay, nice to have breakfast in the room, and very easy to get to the columbia heights metro for all of my meetings downtown and elsewhere. highly recommended!"
67483,983624,2012-03-09,1820022,Amara,we had a wonderful stay in chris's house.  everything was perfectly clean and charmingly designed!
67483,1017570,2012-03-19,889373,Richard,"chris was an awesome host from the minute i inquired about his place. he almost immediately approved my reservation (two other hosts in the same neighborhood never even bothered to respond). he confirmed quickly and provided detailed instructions. his home is super convenient to bus and the metro (halfway between the ch and petworth stations) and was just as described. he provided a well-stocked fridge with breakfast items and fresh fruits, juice and milk. there was some construction right in front with metal plates in the street that clanked whenever a car drove over so i used earplugs as i wanted the windows open at night. he checked mid-stay to see if i needed anything and i wouldn't hesitate to stay again or recommend to someone else who is looking for a great value in dc."
67483,1033208,2012-03-22,52726,Richard,"no other place to stay in dc.  close to everything, comfy, secure.  you gotta stay here."
67483,1044882,2012-03-26,1856734,Marcia,"the fig and holly has an intimate and comfortable setting. we enjoyed the continental breakfast which included granola, multigrain bread, fruit preserves and coffee beans with grinder. the host respected our privacy and he quickly responded to our one request.
we would gladly stay with chris again!"
67483,1092474,2012-04-07,1639160,Pauline,"we had a very pleasant stay at chris's home in columbia heights.  we spent four nights there in order to explore washington dc for the first time.  it proved right for us.  the area was safe, well-lit in the evening when we came back after a day downtown and was convenient for the metro, being ten minutes walk from either columbia heights or georgia-petworth.  the area was quiet at night and the bed comfortable and so we slept well.  breakfast was basic but good quality - granola cereal, apple juice, milk, oranges and organic bread with butter and delicious homemade fig jam, as well as strawberry jam for the more conservative!  there were also fresh organic coffee, organic milk and a selection of organic teas.  there was a small oven/grill for making toast, a microwave and a small fridge/freezer.

chris was helpful, meeting any requirements, ie more milk or sugar, but we had little contact with him as he did not appear to be around much - this seemed to be reflected in other entries in his guest book.

we would recommend columbia heights to anyone who is happy to be independent and doesn't need assistance in their travel or sight-seeing arrangements."
67483,1104452,2012-04-09,1990461,Jill,"we had a pleasant stay and were satisfied with the quality of the accommodations as presented on airbnb.  while the plumbing issue was inconvenient, we benefitted by the more sumptuous bathroom on the second floor.  though no fault of the landlord, the constant noise of the street traffic driving over the loose steel plate on 13th street was the only negative of our stay at fig and holly.  when the road work is complete, future guests will be able to have a better night's sleep.  "
67483,1125169,2012-04-13,2014446,Kimberly,"chris offers a lovely place to stay while visiting the dc area.  the attic space of his beautifully updated victorian home was perfect for my stay.  the bed was very comfortable, the space roomy and the breakfast items were delicious.  even homemade fig jam. yum. the location is great - only 6 blocks from the metro and 3 blocks to cafes and shopping."
67483,1141127,2012-04-16,725353,Sage,"perfect place and perfect host!  i stayed in upper suite.  it was comfortable, lovely, and private.  chris welcomed me when i arrived and oriented me around the neighborhood.  i had travelled to dc to attend a conference but wanted to stay in a place that had more of a dc feel rather than the standard hotel.  i got what i wanted and more -- a comfortable and esthetically pleasing bedroom and living room, an accommodating but not intrusive host in a lively but not noisy neighborhood close enough to my conference to make transportation a breeze.  chris' place will be my first choice next time i am in dc."
67483,1176693,2012-04-25,1592303,Pam,"this is a great location, especially if you are taking public transportation. very comfortable and fairly safe at night. the place itself is comfortable, quiet and private. i would stay there again!"
67483,1209936,2012-05-01,2025098,Nancy,"the location couldn't be better for us. it's not far from the metro, and there's a great bakery just down 14th st. "
67483,1431776,2012-06-07,1144447,Vladislav,"it was our first experience with airbnb. we are very happy that first host was chris. amazing house, great location. all five days flied like one. full comfort and satisfaction."
67483,1495887,2012-06-17,1734467,Tim,"my son and i enjoyed a great stay at chris' place in columbia heights. it was easy to come and go, the apartment was comfortable and quiet, and chris was especially warm and friendly. we were able to easily walk to the subway stop nearby and get to the mall within 15 minutes, when our timing synched with the train schedule. with his apiary, eco-friendly b&b, and massive vinyl collection, chris is a cool guy. the free parking on the street, thanks to a pre-arranged permit by chris, was invaluable. "
67483,1593299,2012-06-30,1630710,Anne,we had a lovely stay. the house is quite charming and located in a quiet neighborhood. restaurants and a few shopping possibilities are near the metro  which is arround 10 min away. everything was just as described and we felt welcomed. 
67483,1697360,2012-07-13,1931540,Katrina And Monica,"what is not to like here? the price is more than right for simple accommodations in dc. you get a whole floor to yourself, a sitting room, bathroom and bedroom - with decent coffee and a grinder to make a fresh pot in the morning. really enjoyed my stay and will be back often."
67483,1725159,2012-07-16,1475434,Jonathan,"i never got to meet chris, but his place was just as advertised and appears as seen in the photos.  everything was neat and tidy when we arrived and checking in and out was a snap.  i needed a bit more time my last day, and chris was able to accommodate my slightly extended stay.  being able to stay in columbia heights was important for my trip (scouting the neighborhood) so i would recommend his home for anyone who wants to explore dc as a local might do."
67483,1765396,2012-07-21,2791678,Joan,"we loved staying here! it's a nice walk to the metro stop in columbia heights, and we were thrilled to get the on-street free parking, which the hosts arranged for us. no problems at all - we were able to come and go as we pleased and had a great stay for much less in terms of money and hassle than we would have trying to book a chain hotel. very highly recommend this for couples or families with older children looking for a great dc experience!"
67483,1820204,2012-07-28,160697,Jeanne,"chris' b&b was great! he made sure our check-in and check-out were easy. even though we didn't see any of the host, they both always were easy to reach and they always answer our questions, before and during our stay. the place is clean, very nicely decorated, the bed and the futon are just wonderful to sleep in, and the fridge with bread, milk, water, jam, fruits, butter and yummy granola was just perfect! we felt at home away from home. plus, it's close to the subway, easy to go to dc downtown and the mall. to conclude: a perfect nest in dc! "
67483,2083508,2012-08-24,1931540,Katrina And Monica,"clean, comfortable and quiet - as always!"
67483,2520334,2012-10-06,3328565,Gail,"we enjoyed the peace and quiet and privacy of this place. it was great having the top floor to ourselves and being self-contained, with our own bathroom, dining table and sitting room. the house below was very quiet. this place was 2 blocks from our son's house, which was super convenient. we enjoyed the walkability to the metro and to neighborhood restaurants, shops and supermarkets."
67483,2595827,2012-10-13,3219774,Mara,"it is a quaint place on the 3rd floor of the house.  it is your own space, though you will need to walk through the house to get there.  the bedroom is nicely sound proof, which will allow you to sleep soundly through the night.  it is located near some great coffee shops and stores.  i also very much enjoyed the jam that chris had in the fridge.  it was delicious!  also, the place was freshly cleaned and extremely comfortable. 
one thing to note: if you plan on having a guest stay on the futon, be aware that the ""living area"" where the futon is will not as sound proof as the bedroom, so if they are a light sleeper noise may travel up the stairs to that room making it hard for them to sleep. 
overall, it was a great experience, and i would recommend it to my friends.  "
67483,2630232,2012-10-16,3305846,Alastair,"we had a great time in dc and we stayed with chris twice during this time.  you get the top floor to yourselves so there is plenty of space and privacy.  the organic breakfast is great and we enjoyed eating and drinking at the meridian pint, 3 blocks away, as recommended by chris."
67483,2672343,2012-10-21,1610662,Elizabeth,"chris provided a charming, quiet and comfortable get-away in columbia heights.  it was just what i needed!  "
67483,2745430,2012-10-29,3504019,Timothy,we had a very relaxing time at the fig and holly. it was very convenient to find the metro and places to eat in columbia heights. we never saw another person in the house and had everything we needed to make our stay stress free. we don't watch tv but if you do make sure to bring a computer since there is not one in the room. chris was very responsive to emails and helpful with our parking. when we come back to the d.c. area we will stay here again. thanks for making our visit even more amazing.
67483,2785766,2012-11-02,3716633,Clara,"we spent hurricane sandy at chris' b & b; it was warm and cozy and we felt quite safe from the storm.  it was very close to our daughter's home, so it was perfect for us.  it's in a great location and feels like your own private apartment; quiet, comfortable, and fully equipped.  perfect for a couple visiting dc, but not for anyone challenged by stairs or getting in and out of a tub."
67483,2884468,2012-11-14,3643571,Lennart,"chris was a good host. the third floor in this wonderful building wasall ours. the apartment was cosy, clean and quite. the organic breakfast he offered was tasty and a good startin the day. nearby there are two subway station to go downtown. all in all it was a really nice place to stay. "
67483,3058110,2012-12-11,3856348,Barbara,"our stay was very pleasant. the location was ideal for us, visiting our son who had recently moved to dc for a new job. the most important part about a b 'n b is the bed and this one was very comfortable. i was amused by the metro shower curtain and plan to get one for our son who works for the metro system. chris' value on ecological activity is aligned with ours and made our stay more satisfying. we enjoyed eating at several local restaurants, one of which especially might be good to know about for future guests. the coupe, a newly opened 24 hour diner, is just two blocks away (11th and monroe). i appreciated the soy milk chris provided for us - at our request - although we didn't use it because we had breakfast with our son each morning. (sorry chris!)
i didn't realize there was no tv in the room, a minor inconvenience, but something i would have enjoyed to wind down after being out all day. we will probably be back at 'the perch' for a future visit with our son."
67483,3269639,2013-01-04,3757902,Olga And Joel,"wonderful place with very sweet touches like granola, coffee, jam, and bread. very clean place and helpful hosts!"
67483,3596311,2013-02-20,2947459,Brianna,"chris' place is an inspiring little oasis in a great neighborhood!  low-key, yet plenty of modern bars and restaurants around. the upstair is so cozy! we enjoyed trying out some new organic shampoos, soaps, not to mention the organic sheets and towels! there was toast and jam, granola and coffee to start the morning off. my favorite were the handmade dishes from poland.  it was a short trip and i didn't have the chance to meet chris, but he was very helpful when we contacted him with a question. i would definitely stay here again if i ever come back to d.c."
67483,3749641,2013-03-11,5073135,Michele,"my husband and i enjoyed our stay in the third floor suite.
it's a charming space.  clean and private.  the bed was very comfortable.
the bathroom is small, but we didn't mind. chris got us a parking permit, so we could park near the house with no problem.  conveniently located to the 14th st. metro and all the shopping and restaurants around that active neighborhood. "
67483,3969980,2013-03-31,473872,Jennifer,the reservation was canceled the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.
67483,4095385,2013-04-09,5200248,R G,"very pleasant apartment, very comfortable and an ideal location since family live several blocks away. chris had everything ready for us including a street parking permit which is necessary for a vehicle. columbia heights neighborhood is very active with stores, restaurants and convenient metro stations. great choice."

67483,4310312,2013-04-27,1869737,Peggy,"the house, the fig and holly, did not look like its photo.  nor did it look like its representation on (hidden by airbnb) earth.  during our stay, the yard (front, back, side) was extremely overgrown.  the front porch and walkway had not been swept in quite some time.  the branches of the iconic fig tree hung low over the front walkway.  they were a hazard during the day, but even more of a hazard at night when there were no groundlights to light the way and no light on the porch (unless the guest had the foresight to turn it on before leaving in the morning).
in short, the exterior of the property has been neglected and i was embarrassed to have friends come and pick us up  there.

the bed linens were stained and uninviting.  one of the towels was also stained.  going up and down a flight of stairs to adjust the thermostat was inconvenient.

yes, the bed was comfortable.  there was tea, coffee, bread, jam, & cereal as promised.
"
67483,4592714,2013-05-14,5103522,Christine,"chris provides a spacious quiet place to stay. you get two huge rooms (a relief after pokey hotel rooms),  and simple kitchen facilities ie a microwave and fridge. 

it's only a short walk to the station and there are frequent trains into the national mall, centre of tourism in washington.

however you are not staying in a touristy area, a relief, in fact it's an interesting area to walk around in and there is a good supermarket (giant) close to the station.

chris replies v promptly to emails and communicates well on general.

i'm sure you will enjoy your stay here.

67483,4700874,2013-05-21,4806989,Ava,we had such a lovely weekend at the fig and holly!! so charming and comfortable. the area is super convenient and quiet. chris was completely accommodating and kind. we would love to stay there again! 
67483,4901043,2013-06-01,5520972,Kerstin,"nice place in the near of the centre of dc, comfortable, cleanly, quietly, be of little way to the metro or the carbike station.
thanks for the good breakfast.
just a few steps are needed to a giant and to authentic restaurants.
chris has an answer for any question.
we had a great time. thanks for all."

67483,5430231,2013-06-30,5404915,Meria,beautiful home and great location! short walk to shops and lots of great places to eat/drink. chris was a great host!

only down side was the front entrance walkway could use the large tree trimmed. "
67483,8318709,2013-10-25,260343,Daniel,chris place was really fun to stay in. clean cozy and checking and getting the key at a totally odd hour was easy. having a micro fridge up in the apartment was really helpful as well. pictures are very accurate! i recommend chris place if you're looking for a comfortable quiet place to stay. it takes about seven minutes to walk to the center of columbia heights and its four or five blocks from a capital bike share stop so getting around isn't too bad even though columbia heights is a bit farther out from a lot of the usual sights.
67483,8638615,2013-11-10,9026905,Natalia,"chris was such a great host, really kind and helpful. we loved our stay. the apartment was tidy and cozy and the area was nice, near to good restaurants and public transportation. if we ever get back to d.c. we'd surely stay at his place! "

72454,191892,2011-03-03,408941,Malisa,"we ended up not going to this particular home.  we went to another one of capital vacation home. this one was not in the most desirable area. we could not find parking, nor felt real safe.  the other one that he offered worked out better for us. the bed's were real comfortable and the house was nice."

72454,2300652,2012-09-17,2795059,Diana,"our group of 6 stayed at the modern charm washington dc rental for 3 days. we found it conveniently located (we did not need a car for our stay, but instead enjoyed a lot of walking). the property was clean and well-maintained, and we found the rooms comfortable."
72454,3728936,2013-03-09,163011,Gail,"we rented this house for our group of friends to attend the national bike summit this year, we filled the house with ten of us and just loved the place. we felt comfortable in the neighborhood and found the nearby shops to be great. the metro was a pleasant walk and the bike share was a joy! neighborhood was quiet. we cooked in, enjoyed the dining space. the wifi was strong, the beds comfortable, the layout exceptional. we will be back! thanks to the owner for his ease of accessibility."
72454,4647859,2013-05-18,954179,Bridget,"i was pleasantly surprised by the size of the house – it was actually larger than i thought it was going to be!  we were a large group – taking up every bed – but we never had any trouble with the hot water heater or having enough room to stretch out and enjoy our time in the evenings.  it was very clean and had all the pots and pans and whatnot necessary for making ourselves at home.  we were shorted a couple bath towels, but they were delivered promptly when i contacted ola.  it was great having the washer and dryer and laundry soap.  the walk to the metro station was a bit long at the end of the day, but there is a bus stop just around the corner. this is a great place for a large group wanting an affordable trip to dc!"
72454,7180150,2013-09-09,5430203,Faustine,"perfect ! we had very nice days in the house.
"
72454,7982726,2013-10-11,6089749,Joshua,the house was comfortable and clean and met our needs for the visit.  we would rent this place again for our group to visit dc for non-profit work travel purposes.  
72454,8595974,2013-11-07,5701187,Laura,"the house was quite spacious and well equipped. we had everything we needed to cook for our big group! communication with the host was easy and courteous. the bus stop was only a couple blocks away, which was great, but the nearest metro station was a good 12-minute walk from the house. if you are not used to public transportation, this might not be ideal. in general, we would rent again from capital vacation rentals!"
72454,9092305,2013-12-06,10012406,Monique,"the house was comfortable and perhaps too large for our party of five.  we easily spread out when we needed space and the communal areas fit us easily. 

it is a little far from the metro stop but it's an easy walk. lots of grocery and shopping available - including organic food. safe neighborhood. overall, great experience. "
78264,2156095,2012-08-31,1973341,Michael,"we had a really good time at their place.

i highly recommend them if you plan to stay in dc"
78264,8634777,2013-11-09,5200207,Margaret,"caterina and francesco were so kind right away! they were quick to respond to my inquiry which i made the day before i needed a place to stay in dc after traveling from nyc. they were great communicators from the first moment to when i said goodbye the following day. they were both there to greet me when i arrived, and although i did not chat with them much due to work deadlines that night, they made sure i had everything i could possibly need and were also so kind to say i could ask them if i had any questions. their home is beautiful, airy, and very welcoming! they have beautiful and friendly cats. i hope to have the chance to get to know them better! i am so grateful for them because they helped me out the morning i left which was so kind and generous of them especially since they must have been tired! i would recommend this space to people if they are looking for a clean and safe place to stay with a very nice couple!"

everything was clean, very nice, and caterina answered promptly to all my messages. i would highly recommend anyone to book with them."
78264,9399986,2013-12-26,10779630,Egon,caterina and francesco were great. highly recommended.
79866,218693,2011-04-05,473411,Rani,this was my first time using airbnb and it was fantastic!  seveer was such a gracious host.  he even picked me up from the bus stop so i didn't have to take a cab.  i stayed in the basement space and had the whole downstairs to myself.  his pictures and description of the space was spot on including the fact that  miko is adorable and very friendly.  the hide-a-way bed was really comfortable and firm.  i highly recommend it to anyone coming to the d.c. area. 
79866,236555,2011-04-23,496964,Uriel,"this was my first experience with airnb, and it was wonderful to be at seveer´s house. he and miko were nice hosts for more than a week. the bus stop is just in front of the door, the place is both quiet and clean, the room has a nice fireplace, flat screen tv, private bathroom, hide-a-way bed, small refrigerator, and laundry room. definitely, i will back there for my next trip to dc."
79866,285072,2011-05-28,568543,Indra,"this is my first experience using b&b and it was  extremely helpful in choosing a host. seveer is such a genuine and wonderful person. the place is quiet, clean and i enjoyed a much needed and peaceful rest after checking out palces of interests. the hide-away bed was neat. highly recommended to anyone visiting dc. i know that i'll be back."
79866,632568,2011-10-16,855726,Michael And Kymberlee,"what a charming alternative to big (or even small) hotels. seveer greatly exceeded my expectations. picked me up at the airport! gave me a local tour when i arrived to get oriented to the location of restaurants, groceries, etc. house has a great sense of style and has recently been extensively remodeled. only potential drawback is neighborhood may be a bit less gentrified than some would find comfortable. that being said, i never felt unsafe walking to and from my three-day function at gallaudet university. would definitely stay there again. "
79866,1912056,2012-08-07,2300982,Morgan,"seveer was very nice and accommodating. the house is beautiful and exceptionally clean -- just how it looks in the photos. all of the people in the neighborhood were very friendly to me, and i didn't have any problems, though more skittish people who aren't used to urban areas should note that this is a neighborhood undergoing the process of gentrification. it is also quite a trek from the nearest subway station (about 1.3 miles), though there are lots of buses that stop within a block of the house.

this experience was not exactly what i was expecting. it was not until i arrived that i found out i would be staying in seveer's bedroom (he was on a couch in the basement) instead of one of the guest rooms. a friend of his was staying in the basement, and another airbnb guest was in the upstairs guest room -- essentially, he overbooked the place. he did not mention this to me when we talked on the phone, but did mention that the other airbnb guest would be upstairs, which led me to believe that i would have lots of privacy and my own bathroom in the basement. instead i was sharing a bathroom with seveer and the other airbnb guest upstairs, and had very little room to put everything that i brought for my 5.5 week stay (and no room at all in the bathroom). he also stayed in his bedroom while i was in new york for the weekend without asking me if it would be okay or telling me that he was staying there (i found out from the other guest). the place was very nice, and i got along well with seveer, but i wish he would have at least told me about this before i arrived."

93551,279726,2011-05-24,246665,Tariq,"in short: book it, this is easy to recommend. 

in long: my wife and i had a great stay with chris. he was accommodating to our changing schedule and welcomed us with an orientation and guide to the area.

the room is large and has plenty of storage space. similarly, the bathroom is big, clean and has all the bits you need. the tea and coffee machine is great in the morning.

the bed is ridiculously huge and extremely comfortable. the house is well located - a few minutes away from a metro stop and the bustling u street area.

enjoy!

93551,310532,2011-06-12,668551,Dave,"after experiencing hours of flight delays and arriving much later than expected, it was great to finally arrive to comfort and good company. the house is super easy to get to from the metro station & we spent a couple hours talking and getting to know each other. 

chris was an excellent host and the room was exactly as presented on the site. he was very thoughtful as a host, everything i could need was ready in the room & gave me all the advice and help i needed to get around. the bed itself was super comfy, you have a private bathroom & shower.

tldr: awesome host, great room, close to metro."

93551,331885,2011-06-24,574413,John,"loved the simple, homey, unpretentious, accommodations where we were able to come and go as we pleased. chris welcomed us and generoulsy took us to the police station to get a free street parking pass for our stay. we were within walking distance of the subway and only a few stops from the mall. we felt at home and everything was as advertised.

93551,1524373,2012-06-20,2442195,Barton,"     had a great experience at chris' house.  if you're looking for a place to crash with a friendly host, near metro and across the street from great (& cheap) indian food, this is your spot.   the bed is extremely comfortable and the attached bath has been recently renovated.  
     chris was able to accommodate my odd arrival time and had gave me plenty of advice on how to get around and where to find good food, coffee, etc.  the wireless internet is fast and there's apple tv in the room.  the two dogs mostly stay downstairs and couldn't have been better behaved.  i will miss lukos.

93551,2855419,2012-11-11,3568252,Alan,"very good bedroom and en-suite bathroom, with the best bed in the world. location also good. the host chris is a complete gentleman and made me very welcome indeed. 

only a few little problems. the room suffers from no real natural daylight and the lights for some strange reason are blue and red. the room is also at the front of the house on a very busy street so it can be quite noisy and the room can shake if a truck goes past. 

overall a good stay. best of luck for the future chris. "

93551,4493517,2013-05-08,5397651,Katrin,"a good place in a central location to explore dc  with only a short walk to metrostation.
the neighborhoud is fine, only the road in front of the house is kind of noisy, its one of the bigger roads with lots of traffic. but with closed windows and earplugs we did sleep well, the bed is huge and super comfortable, 

we liked the room and bathroom, both nicely done and clean.

the rooms downstairs needed just a little improvement when it comes to cleanliness, but it was ok for me. with several roommates you don't have the kitchen usually as organized and clean compared to a ""classical housewife"".

we met chris and his dog, both easygoing and everyone in the house was friendly and helpful. 
"
93551,6581752,2013-08-18,6058731,Renato,"chris and bryan are awesome hosts, and made my wife and i felt completely at home during the two months we spent at their place. the left us completely free to make ourselves comfortable, and to use their amazing living room (with an equally amazing couch + tv) and amazing kitchen (with correspondingly amazing utensils and equipment). they were also extremely flexible in trying to solve a misunderstanding caused by me, when i misread the posting at airbnb, doing whatever was in their reach to make us comfortable.
chris and bryan are also very nice and interesting people, and my wife and i really look forward to meeting them again in the future! "
116289,312341,2011-06-13,636719,Angela,"convenient and comfortable! sharyn's townhome provided so much relaxation and access to so many things that the dc metro area has to offer. everything was in short walking distance including the subway system, restaurants, and markets - i also enjoyed the hospitality of the neighbors! sharyn was a great hostess and provided plenty of good info about the area. if you are looking for a safe, comfortable, and convenient location, definitely consider this bnb!

116951,307037,2011-06-10,457162,Jessica,"the room is very nice and well presented.  there was a bottle of water and a glass by the bed and everything seemed nice and clean.  chris himself was there for a short time but came through for me by allowing me to stay an extra day after my flight was canceled and took the time to be there to let me back into the apartment.  there are multiple rooms that are rented out in this apartment and it was great having a chance to meet new people and chat.  the only bad thing about the room is that while chris has done a very good job lighting the room with light fixtures, don't expect the sunlight to wake you up in the morning.  the room has one window but it is shaded by a set of stairs that keep the room from getting much outdoor light.  "
116951,309065,2011-06-11,457162,Jessica,so glad he was able to fit me in at the last minute due to a flight cancellation.  i loved chatting that last evening and he was very helpful with any information i needed while trying to find my way out of the city after the cancellation.
116951,317721,2011-06-16,336319,Andre,"the room at chris' is super comfortable, with a huge tv and a bed that encourages much sleeping.  chris is a charming host with useful travel and dining tips. his dogs are very friendly, yet far from intrusive.  we liked the location, with u-street and 14th street nearby for dining, and good access to the metro and city bikes."
116951,322948,2011-06-19,692229,Graeme,"i really enjoyed my stay at chris's household, which was a very relaxed and interesting group.  the room and facilities were clean and complete.  chris is a fine host and was very helpful on a number of occasions."
116951,335626,2011-06-26,673322,Jesse,chris and his roommates were great to hang out with.  it made my first week in dc a fun one.  i'd definitely recommend chris' house to anyone.
116951,342568,2011-06-29,18664,Tracy,comfortable bed and a great location for my conference -- a 10- to 15-minute walk to the convention center. -- luke
116951,345013,2011-06-30,742963,Robin,"chris was very hospitable, even taking me on a short drive in the neighborhood.  room was clean, bandwidth was fast"
116951,386744,2011-07-21,554879,Miriam,"we were staying in the room for a bit more than two weeks and had a really good time.
the room and house are equipped with everything one could wish for, especially also for a longer stay - tv, wireless internet, private bathroom, washing machine and dryer and a huge, awesome kitchen...
the house is really beautiful, also the back garden and it is located in a nice and comfortable neighbourhood. the metro being very close it is really easy to get around in washington.
chris was very friendly and helpful as were his housemates. i was especially grateful for the explanation of the street system of washington to make it easier to get around as a foreigner. lastly, the dogs are good and easygoing company, too;-)"
116951,395705,2011-07-25,660326,Chanel,"chris and his roommate were very friendly and kind. their space is large, quirky and interesting.  the house is very lived-in, so although reasonably clean, it tends to be cluttered. their dogs were well behaved and kept contained.

chris is laid back and easy to get along with. i enjoyed his company  although we didn't get to talk a lot because i was there for a conference and gone most  days. i was provided good information about the neighborhood and i was able to get around easily.

the room is as shown in the picture and while small is comfortable. there is easy access to the internet and to cable tv.

the neighborhood near this house is a little sketchy for a single woman traveling alone, so use caution. it is not advisable to walk alone after dark."
116951,411844,2011-08-01,805976,Kenneth,great stay in dc. i did not meet chris but he reached out several times prior and during to make sure everything was good. i would recommend chris's to anyone. a wonderful host.
116951,421796,2011-08-05,234836,Margot,"chris and company were very hospitable.  easy to be around.

for those intersted in a dark,quiet space to stay - this is the one.  a 5 minute walk to the metro in a safe neighborhood.  

thanks chris!"
116951,452197,2011-08-16,950806,Glenn,"i unfortunately didn't get to meet chris but he was in touch well before i got to dc and during to make sure that all was good with my stay and if there was anything he could help with. i did meet his 2 legged and 4 legged housemates and even his neighbour and they were all very friendly and easy going, the 4 legged ones especially loved a pat. the room is perfect for what you need, bed was great (i slept really well) and had it's own en-suite. that alone is better than most hotel rooms i've stayed at. didn't use any of the house facilities as was only there late at night ready for bed but it has the works if you want them with big tv, living room and kitchen (and apparently back garden). 
this was my first airbnb experience and i admit to being nervous about it but it was better than any impersonal hotel experience. i'd stay at chris' again if i make it back to dc anytime soon."
116951,458361,2011-08-19,917921,Scott 'N Jess,"chris had a very clean room ready for me on arrival in the afternoon.... basically what you see in the photos. the bed was firm and very comfortable and for a first-time airbnb user the experience was very easy with prompt and detailed responses from chris regarding access to the apartment, meeting times, etc."
116951,500329,2011-09-04,957206,Clay,"this was my first airbnb experience and it could not have been better. the room is great with everything you could possibly need. chris is a wonderful host! every detail was covered and chris was very welcoming and helpful to me in my relocation to his city. his roommates and dogs were great too! every day when i entered the house, i felt welcome. the location is great,  just around the corner from the metro. when i return to dc, i hope i can stay at chris's again."
116951,514818,2011-09-08,984618,Sid,"chris was very accomodating. i needed a place to stay rather urgently and chris made the effort to make me fee right at home.  the place was great, very nice inside-out...a huge flat screen tv with umpteen channels to keep you company.  the neighborhood is awesome and has easy access to metro. chris is a well read and well travelled host with whom you will enjoy talking with. i would stay there again in a heartbeat."
116951,531013,2011-09-14,950891,Nicholas,"this was my first use of airbnb and i enjoyed my time at chris's place. you have to like dogs which was ok by me - there are three big very friendly dogs.  the place is clean and air-conditioned which was a mercy when i was there as it was quite muggy outside. it's also great access on washington's metro. chris was always helpful to me, helping out with quite a few tricky problems i had as a newby to washington. "
116951,540806,2011-09-17,61980,Siavash,"the transaction was very smooth. everything seemed very well thought-out from picking up the key, leaving wifi password on a sticky, labeling the room with my name, leaving a bottle of water with a cup, and even leaving the light on for when i arrived. room was clean and looked like the pictures. chris was also very good with communication. would definitely book again."
116951,545975,2011-09-19,1000292,Sylvain,"it is a great place to stay at. it is accessible, near metro station. the room is comfortable and the host very friendly."
116951,560381,2011-09-23,1140029,Pavel,"staying at chris place was great. room is very convenient, clean and comfortable. wifi is working properly, nice kitchen where you can make tea or coffee. also great and super cute dogs :). chris's place definitely recommended!"
116951,572667,2011-09-26,890576,Susan,"chris and keith were very  helpful the moment we stepped foot in the front door and super friendly.  the room and ensuite was clean and adequate  (plenty of storage space) and  well lit - maps, what to see and do in washington dc , were readily available.  coffee, tea and creamer were supplied only, but there would not have been a problem bringing in your own supplies and cooking in the kitchen which was well equipped.  as we did not have a computer or mobile phone keith was a total gem in helping us book onward travel and looking up information regarding future accommodation and  as we were traveling around america they both gave us a few suggestions and advice.  chris was very attentive and kept stressing ""if there was anything we needed just to call him.""  everything went to plan and there were not hiccups regarding collection of keys - everything was sorted and done in a professional manner and it was a pleasure dealing with chris and it was our great fortune meeting his lodger keith who was a total gem  - they were both great guys and i would recommend staying there.  the location was  central to everything by metro train just around the corner.  nothing was a hassle.  thank you guys once again for making our stay a memorable one .........suzy and ros "
116951,580304,2011-09-29,837591,Brandt,chris was really keen to make sure we had everything we needed for our stay in washington.  the room & facilities was lovely and we slept really well there.  its not too far from the mall - about a 30 min walk or less on the subway but we enjoyed the excercise & the scenery :-)  
116951,597319,2011-10-04,920625,Nicole,"i enjoyed my recent stay at chris' house and loved dc. we had great communication prior to and during my visit, and everything was as expected from the photos and description. chris' housemates were  friendly and helpful too. great location to access everything in dc. thanks so much.  "
116951,611431,2011-10-09,256271,Lea,"staying at chris' place complemented my visit to dc. the location was perfect for me. the national mall is within walking distance in an area i felt safe in. a cab from the train station is maybe $6-7. whole foods is a few blocks away so i packed lunches and did not need to eat out at all. a metro station is about 6 blocks away, and that line goes straight to dca (regan airport) with no transfer. the room is good-sized and the private bathroom very clean. chris has two roommates and the house felt laid back and safe for me as a woman traveling alone. chris is friendly and helpful and his two soft golden retrievers are the best! thank you."
116951,631820,2011-10-16,873858,Cengiz,"chris is a responsible and helpful man. when i was not able to get in, he was there in 5 minutes to open the door. he also let me an american type electrical cable to enable me use my computer.
he is a very busy man, but he was able to afford time for his guests."
116951,654604,2011-10-23,603419,Mohamed,"chris is a very welcoming, gracious, and respectful host. the room is beautifully decorated, was well-suited to my  needs and conveniently situated near public transportation. his dogs are beautiful and calm, and his housemates are personable and courteous. i'll always stay at his place when i'm there."
116951,673114,2011-10-29,1014028,Salvador,"i stayed at chris' place for a whole work week. he was a great host; checked in constantly with me in case i needed anything even though he is a busy entrepreneur with a few projects simultaneously. the room is as it looks in the pics, and there is a lot of living room space and his lovely dogs. i worked all day and had virtually no contact with his roommates, given their schedules. i would recommend this place, as it is neat, clean, comfortable, and the house is 4 blocks from the shaw metro station. it is ideal for 1 person, but two could also enjoy their stay. check it out!"
116951,688669,2011-11-02,1353993,Carla,"i liked staying at chris's house.
 the room was simple, neat and clean.
i would recommend this stay to others.

not much in the way of restaurants in the immediate area. no place to pick up coffee to go or have breakfast before heading out for the day."
116951,700366,2011-11-07,293151,Chris,"chris is an excellent example of why i love airbnb so much. not only was the room the right combination of privacy, location, and ""at home"" comfort, but he was an excellent host and i had a blast. i feel like i've got a great friend in dc now and i definitely will stay again."
116951,733020,2011-11-21,1021564,Robin,"i had a very good experience at chris' place.  he was warm, friendly, and welcoming even though i arrived early in the morning ~9 am the night after someone else had departed.  the dogs were friendly but chill.  i was busy at a conference so didn't spend too much time socializing with chris or his housemate.  there's good food around the corner from the house."
116951,762530,2011-12-04,558466,Tod,chris was warm and inviting. the room was great as well as the dogs! instructions on accessing entry was perfect and he even told us to be sure to change the parking! 
116951,790484,2011-12-17,679157,Jeremy,chris is an incredibly gracious host and a very good communicator. this is a great place to stay.
116951,844917,2012-01-06,1409253,Yirko,everything was ok
116951,977715,2012-03-07,690377,Bev,"chris is friendly and helpful, and the location of his home was great for our needs. the room and bath were fine and the nearby powder room was convenient since it gave my husband and me a ""second"" bathroom when needed. we would highly recommend a restaurant just a block away--beau thai. fabulous!

two complaints: the kitchen, though quite spacious, was also quite dirty and therefore unpleasant to use. the front porch needs some repair--a danger of falling there.
"
116951,989631,2012-03-11,905855,Andrew,"chris was a great host!  communication was easy, expectations were clear, and all needs were addressed upon arrival.  i'd definitely recommend the location."
116951,1238782,2012-05-07,1913971,Nikolay,"i spent about one month and a half at chris’s house. it was nice, tidy room and not far from the center of the city (easy access to metro and bus stops). price is reasonable, and the place is good and comfortable. free wi-fi internet, clean kitchen, cozy common room and apple tv – what else is necessary to spend the evening after a long work day? chris is very friendly and helpful. he was always ready to advise where to go and what to see in washington.  all in all, i enjoyed my time at chris’s house, and, next time, i will definitely stay at his place. "
116951,1265775,2012-05-12,1878563,Joshua,"chris's place is lovely, very comfortable, and very welcoming! even though chris was out of town, everything was laid out and accessible, more than we could have expected. plush towels, excellent bed, water filter, it was like being at home, only better! 

his place is very close to a metro stop, so great access to whereever you need to be, and there are good restaurants and amenities in easy walking distance (we especially liked the red toque cafe across the street), a great coffee house, the list goes on.  we had an impressive flat screen in our room, and were able to enjoy a movie from bed.

chris himself is a gracious host, and his four legged friends are friendly and affectionate.  i can only say in closing that i highly recommend his home as a convenient and comfortable base for your visit, better than any hotel i've stayed in, and more fun!"
116951,1705486,2012-07-14,293151,Chris,"another awesome stay with chris. he took great care of me and i was super happy with my room. his home is in a great location and i felt quite comfortable. just what i was looking for.

he even introduced me to an awesome yet casual french restaurant in town. you can't go wrong with chris as a host."
116951,2745806,2012-10-29,3452196,John,"chris was super welcoming and accommodating, letting you know he was there if you needed something but respecting space and privacy as well. the room is super comfortable for a short or long stay and has everything you need. access is great because you can come and go from the room without worrying about disturbing anyone. highly recommended!"
116951,2898398,2012-11-16,2250585,John,"i wish i had gotten to spend more time with chris, who is a fascinating person. but his home is so welcoming, well-located, and comfortable. i was in dc on a short trip, arriving late. chris had everything set up. i was in a good-sized room with a private bath. although i never turned it on, he had a huge television in the room. great wi-fi covered the house. chris's home was close to the metro and, especially nice for me, a bike share station. but one is just a mile and a half from the capitol building. great host. great house. great location. couldn't ask for more!"
116951,3400412,2013-01-23,4153893,Linda,"staying with chris was staying at home.  we felt very comfortable from the minute we walked into the door.  chris is very friendly, hospitable and helpful.  we looked forward to returning in the evening, knowing that we could relax and have some fun conversations with him.  when we return to dc, we will stay with him again!"
116951,3979538,2013-04-01,4722966,Kit,"chris was a great host that really wanted to ensure i was comfortable during my time in the district. during my month-long stay at his place, he proved very responsive, a good communicator, and just a very nice guy throughout. i strongly recommend renting from him!"
116951,4113326,2013-04-10,5780013,Garrett,"i recently stayed with chris macdonald's ""upscale private close to everything"" it was my first time using airbnb as was recommended by a friend. chris has set the high standards for the future as was as it says on the tin upscale private and close to everything. i was attending a conference at the washington conference center and it was in easy walking distance to it as well as the metro which is on a direct line to ronald regan (dca) airport. also walking distance to 7th street and florida avenue (u street) for food and drinks. it was excellent place to stay which had all and more of the comforts of the very expensive and overpriced dc hotels. four people were staying there who were like minded and even went out socially with them so he attracts the right type of people but private if you wanted. i would highly recommend chris's place if in dc and will try airbnb again but as said before chris has set the gold standard!!  garrett"
116951,4865180,2013-05-29,2240359,David,great place. thanks chris. i managed to knock out most of the work planned. excellent place and facilities. cheers.~
116951,5011901,2013-06-07,413375,Ben,"chris is a top-notch host and his place is exactly as advertised—hence all the spot-on positive reviews here.  my week-long stay in d.c. was my first time in the city and chris went out of his way to offer advice and help me navigate the area—but was never pushy.  this is a place where you can have total privacy when you want it but chris and other guests are around if you're feeling social.  the wi-fi is excellent, the kitchen is kept clean, and there is the right balance of private space and common space.  if you have a car, parking can be tricky but i always managed to find a spot no more than 1 block away. public transportation is very convenient here, so if you don't need a car for other reasons, you definitely won't need one to stay at chris' place.  i give it ten stars! ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆"
116951,7849402,2013-10-06,8054592,Will,"i stayed in the home for four weeks as i moved to d.c to start work and look for permanent housing. the home and room are as advertised and reflect previous reviews. 

house is in a dynamic neighborhood within walking distance to 14th street, dupont, and u street night life. steps away from the green/yellow line and also a quick 20 minute walk to downtown (metro center area).

i would highly recommend staying here.  "
116951,9342777,2013-12-23,8729726,Thilo,"chris’ and bryan’s house is fabulous. everything is neat and tidy, the furniture is classy and well-chosen, the beds are comfy and the bathrooms are clean and offer everything you need.
their dog lucas – only around when chris or bryan are in – is the nicest dog i have met in my life: very friendly to strangers and charmingly calm.
although chris and bryan only stayed in occasionally during my stay, i am glad to have met them. they are awesome hosts and do everything to make you feel comfortable and at home. not only are they nice guys but also exciting characters which makes it really fun hanging out with them. on top of that, they have the ability to choose the right people for their place and match them very well. i shared the house with two other airbnb users and the three of us were a very good match.
their house’s location is central indeed. it’s only a 5min walk to the hip u st, offering good night live, plus they have 2 capital bikeshare stations, where you can rent a bike for very little money and take it around dc. the dupont circle is just a 10min bike ride away, which offers not just office buildings but also many nice restaurants – try the bistrot du coin when you’re a steak enthusiast. 

i highly recommend the place for the hosts’ friendliness, their great house and the proximity to central washingto dc, nw.

145726,330947,2011-06-23,26591,Yisrael,"this experience with an airbnb host was my best by far!  sakhi was very accommodating to us, answering questions regarding dc and actually assisting us with neighborhood suggestions for our planned move!  the apt itself is in a great local neighborhood, about a 10 minute walk down tree lined streets to the metro and restaurants and shops.  it's also walkable to the restaurant and bar scenes of columbia heights and while adams morgan and u street are a little further we walked to them as well.  the apartment itself is beautiful, just renovated by the owner with comfortable bed and couch, cable and wifi and a well stocked kitchen (sakhi even left a bottle of wine!).  

truthfully, if sakhi was renting this out on a one year lease, we would have signed up and rented his apt--definitely the best deal in dc!"
145726,346794,2011-07-01,678017,Brett,"this is a very nice place and sakhi was a great guy, even though we only met briefly. it is 15 minute walk from the nearest metro station, but then only a short ride into the downtown areas. the place is kitted out elegantly, and sakhi provided some cold beers and wine, which was very welcoming."
145726,372900,2011-07-14,496921,Mark,"we had a great stay at sakhi's dc 'loft' apartment -- it's very modern, fully furnished with a homely feel and well-stocked -- we were very comfortable and would stay again. great bed, bathroom, cable tv and wi-fi. it's a 15-20 minute walk to the metro subway to head off exploring the city. we really appreciated the fruit, snacks, beer and wine that was waiting on arrival, thanks sakhi!"
145726,387494,2011-07-21,764946,Peter,"i really enjoyed staying in sakhi's studio suite. it had everything a guest would need including washer & drier and full cooking facilities. the location is excellent with only a couple of blocks to buses and also to several good restaurants. i also really enjoyed the neighborhood. almost everyone you pass says hello and  people even greet you from their porches as you walk by. very friendly place!
sakhi was a very good host, very responsive when there was a problem with the shower. he also offered some good wine and there was beer and basic groceries such as eggs, bagels, fruit and cheese for me.
i will definitely re-book when i return to the dc area."
145726,404435,2011-07-29,768373,Nicolas,"this is a great place, beautifully furnished and decorated, and sakhi is a awesomet host.  would definitely recommend to anyone!  fully equipped kitchen, washer and dryer in apartment - in short everything you would need for a comfortable stay.  "
145726,416314,2011-08-02,42194,Lillian,"what i really liked about sakhi and his family is that they will always come out of their house to chat with you from time to time, instead of just handing you the key and minding their own business.  in addition, i really loved the basement loft.  it was clean, comfortable and fyi, the loft was built and designed entirely by sakhi.  he also has a really cute garden with a willow tree, swing and a fire pit, a great place to sit and have breakfast while immersing yourself in tranquility.  the location was also really convenient, few steps from grocery/restaurants and 15 min walk to metro station.  sakhi was also really patient and knowledgeable, as our car broke down, sakhi was able to let us stay for an extra night and direct us to a mechanic that provided a reasonable price!  would i come back again to stay?  definitely!

"
145726,428363,2011-08-08,771481,Rebeca,"the luraloft is great and its owner too! the loft is really spacious, sooo cool decorated and well located. the apt is ready to guest, you have whatever thing you need: laundry, iron, kitchen ware, ac, comfy sofa, nice tv, books, music etc... and the neighborhood is so nice: residential and calm, well connected, restaurants and supermarkets around (yes! organic too) and with neighbors that say you ""good morning"" even you don´t know them :) luraloft has another advantage which is called shaki, he´s really helpful and kind and makes your stay in an unknown place easier."
145726,453485,2011-08-17,849246,Liza,"overall we had a great time in dc and sakhi's place! the basement apartment is beautifully decorated and has everything one needs for a comfortable stay. the only bit of a problem we had was with ac, it wasn't cooling the apartment to a comfortable at least 80f, plus it was too loud and for the night we had to turn it off. if you are a heavy sleeper, you probably wouldn't have problems with it though. the internet was also on a slow side: we couldn't watch videos. it was important for us, but i understand that for most of the people it's not a priority, especially with the cable tv there. 
the area is decent, the house is 20 minutes walk from the closest metro, but the bus stop is very close and can take you to chinatown in no time. 
sakhi is a great host. a bottle of wine and a whole bowl of fruits welcome us upon arrival! moreover, he was super fast to reply to any of our concerns or questions, and even organized an early check-in for us!

thank you!

145726,495825,2011-09-02,957764,Candice,"i was unlucky enough to visit d.c. during an earthquake and hurricane, but staying at sakhi's loft was so comfortable, i barely noticed.  he's a fantastic host--welcoming, laid-back and accommodating, and the place itself is really nicely furnished and designed. there are also several small parks in the area, which also made it ideal for my dog.  it truly felt like a home away from home and i'd definitely recommend it!"
145726,527482,2011-09-13,688798,Carlena,"we really enjoyed our stay at luraloft, it was clean, comfortable and very homely. unfortunately we did not get to meet shaki due to a busy schedule but he was very accommodating and gave us directions to allow ourselves to check in early. 

inside the apartment is surprisingly spacious and modern. we were welcomed with wine and fruit and information about d.c. 

our stay was very comfortable and we were reluctant to leave!

145726,537867,2011-09-16,1146187,Edgardo,"dear sakhi, we are grateful for the pleasant stay. you are very friendly and will gladly recommend ""lura loft"" as a good alternative. we are at your service. thanks and regards from cleveland park (dc). edgardo"
145726,553972,2011-09-21,853413,Monica,"i had a great stay at luraloft.  i'm familiar with the washington dc area, but needed somewhere to stay.  there was ample parking right in front of the apt. sakti went out of his way to meet me at the apartment when i came in rather late.  first of all, i loved the bathroom, and the kitchen was fully stocked if i wanted to cook, and with breakfast items in the fridge.    there was free wireless and tv.  i felt safe - as a woman alone - coming and going during the day and in the evenings, and i was close to restaurants if i wanted to eat nearby.  this was my first airbnb stay and i am now a fan!"
145726,570400,2011-09-26,369869,Kat,"the luraloft is super-cool, newly renovated, and squeaky clean. we loved staying here! the separate office desk area was especially useful since i had a little work to do while we were in dc. sakhi was a gracious host and very responsive to questions. the apartment is very comfortable and quiet. we stayed 6 days and travelled via metro daily. although it's a 15 or 20 minute walk to teh station, you can take tree-lined, quiet, residential streets or the much busier way along georgia avenue. we really enjoyed the walk in fact. we felt safe and cared for and absolutely recommend staying here!!"
145726,586466,2011-10-01,681852,Franziska,"the b&b was for my mom and brother, who visited me in dc. the apartment itself was really nice and the way it was described. but the place is in one of the not-so-nice parts in dc and my mom did not feel safe at night. the metro station is a good 20-minute walk away. 
eventhough there was a bottle of wine, when they arrived, the breakfast only lastet for one day. they also never had the oppurtunity to meet the host, which was kind of sad. "
145726,607112,2011-10-07,1218819,Agnieszka,"we really enjoyed our stay at luraloft. this apartment is very cozy, nicely decorated and well equipped. sakhi is a good host. he agreed on early check in, welcomed us with a botle of wine and a bowl of fruit and provided us with some info we needed. the only inconvenience is 20 min walk to the nearest subway station but for us walking is a pleasure so we are definately coming back!"
145726,670650,2011-10-28,1166097,Annette,"amazing experience!  couldn't have chosen a better place to stay!  sakhi was a very hospitable host.  the very comfortable apartment was stocked with enough breakfast food and kitchen essentials (eggs, butter, coffee, coffeemaker filters, dishwashing detergent, papertowel, etc.) for the first three or four days.  sakhi also provided us with fresh fruits and a bottle of wine when we first arrived.  there was even tide detergent available in the linen closet! queen sized bed was comfortable.  free parking was definitely a plus.  we had no problem finding parking just a few steps from the house everyday, even when we came in late.  free wifi was convenient and quick.  sakhi was only a phone call or text away when we had questions. there was a fire pit in the backyard which sakhi gladly started for us upon request.  we drove into the city and parked downtown so i cannot comment on the ease of using public transportation.  "
145726,693168,2011-11-05,1204989,Andrea,"my husband and i stayed a week at luraloft. it was clean, warm and cozy. it looks exactly like the pictures. we walked through the neighborhood during the day and jogged through the streets in the evening. i always felt safe and the neighbors were friendly. sakhi is a good man to deal with. he is personable and friendly and made me feel welcome. i would definitely stay there again."
145726,708523,2011-11-10,1371264,Brigid,"i was hired for a short term job in dc on a wednesday and expected to start work the following monday. i spent the next few days freaking out about where i was going to stay when i came upon the luraloft listing. the apartment is great, looks just like the pictures. sakhi was extremely helpful while booking the property and when i arrived. he went above and beyond when he helped me find a place to stay for the week other tenants are booked. i look forward to returning there for the remainder of my stay in dc!"
145726,729208,2011-11-19,1097694,Martina,"my mother and i spend 8 nights in the lura loft and sakhi contributed so much to a wonderful stay! the apartement is nice and cozy and during weekdays, there is an express bus just around the corner which takes you in about 10 minutes into the city. in addition, there is a slower one with more stops which is also in service at weekends and it needs about 20 minutes. 
i would definetly recommend this place!"
145726,854866,2012-01-10,135739,Sandra,"my stay in sakhi's apartment was about as perfect as it could have been. sakhi was a very friendly and welcoming host, the apartment was beautiful, spotless, quiet, comfortable, and the little extras, like breakfast cereal and fruit, really made a difference, both in terms of convenience and just feeling welcomed. i also found the neighborhood really charming, very quiet and low-key, and not really far from the center of town if you don't mind a walk to the metro. "
145726,864420,2012-01-16,358292,Anders,"the luraloft is the perfect airbnb crash pad in washington dc!! 

located in a beautifully and expertly renovated basement of sakhi's own home, this hidden gem has everything the tourist or business traveler will need to make their stay in dc as comfortable as possible. there is a brand new full-sized kitchen with breakfast bar, brand new bathroom with a great shower, full laundry and a large open plan shared living/sleeping space. the bed is great and the whole place is really very private and quiet. everything is freshly renovated, modern and was spotless!! 

sakhi was there to greet us when we arrived, he even provided fresh fruit, breakfast groceries and a bottle of wine to enjoy on our first night. our stay at luraloft was probably one of the best we have had on airbnb.

don't be scared by the distance from the city either! the place is in a quiet and interesting neighborhood a reasonable walk and subway ride from the national mall. if you don't want to walk at night a cab is only about $10-15 max. we mostly walked to colombia heights or caught a subway downtown.

if your looking for a quieter, unique and relaxing stay in dc, this is your place!

"
145726,982806,2012-03-09,1562136,De,enjoyed my stay at the luraloft.  sakhi was a great host.  i had everything i needed in the apt and it looks just like the photos.  the area was quiet and easily accessible to the metro.  i stayed for entire month without any issues.  would definitely recommend this place to anyone wishing to visit dc.  thanks again sakhi!  best wishes
145726,1005707,2012-03-17,1590893,Amy,our stay at sakhi's exceeded our expectations! this was our first time using airbnb and our experience was great. the apartment was very clean and looks just like the photos shown. the fridge had several items for breakfast which was most appreciated. we met sakhi's kids and they were both very well mannered. i enjoyed meeting his daughter as dhe is learning sign language. the apartment was in a nice neighborhood and the people we met on the street there were very friendly and polite. i would definitely recommend this apt. to anyone visiting dc. 
145726,1068563,2012-04-01,685104,Robyn,"sakhi and his place were both excellent. he was extremely accommodating when we had to adjust our arrival/departure times on both ends of the trip. though he was sick when he showed up, his girlfriend, melo, showed us around, and he was awesome about answering our couple of questions via text. he also left us bagels and yogurt! which was so nice. the apartment itself is exactly as gorgeous as in the pictures. we particularly appreciated the large desk in the entry nook--we came with papers to grade and writing to do.

we had a good time in the neighborhood; we recommend the cinnamon rolls at flip it bakery & deli (so good), and the la moderna at moroni & brothers pizza (i'm a sucker for egg on pizza). 

our only regret was that we didn't see enough of patches, sakhi's adorable mop of a dog. but we had a great trip; the cherry blossoms came early this year!"
145726,1097587,2012-04-08,1828303,Pascal,"my partner and i went to dc for a week to try to find a place to live in the summer and had a great time here. it was my first time using airbnb and sakhi definitely set a high standard. he was very quick in getting back to me, had a few things in the fridge to get us started, and was very helpful in leaving around a lot of maps, bus schedules, and take-out menus. the place is exactly as pictured, so you know what you're getting. i ended up finding a place elsewhere in petworth for the summer, so i'm glad i got to spend a week in the neighborhood beforehand. thanks again for everything sakhi!"
145726,1414101,2012-06-04,945905,Mary,"sakhi was our very first host and we couldn't have had a better time.  the apartment was exactly as described.  patches the dog and sakhi met us for an early check in and got us settled with a fridge stocked with breakfast foods and a couple of beers.  we enjoyed the 15 minute walk to and from the metro and met a few cats & neighbors along the way each day.  the neighborhood was residential, quiet, and safe and we felt fine walking around both very late at night and during the day.  the bed was comfy, the ac kept us cool, and the shower had great water pressure.  what more can you ask for? "
145726,1531306,2012-06-21,68870,Jim & Afiyah,"a home away from home, with a superb host and an extremely comfortable environment.  the luraloft is superior - clean, beautifully furnished, and complete with everything you need for your stay - including a kitchen, parking, wifi, cable, washer and dryer.  with such comfort and convenience, it's easy to wish that you booked a longer stay.  the customer service and hospitality that sakhi offers is top-notch.  i would recommend this place to anyone looking for a home away from home in dc!"
145726,1602010,2012-07-01,2312249,Elizabeth,"my boyfriend was on his first vacation to the united states, and we searched long and hard for the right place to stay. you absolutely get what you see in the pictures, a beautiful and spacious apartment, perfect for 2.
as i've read from other comments, we were greeted with a lovely gift of wine and fresh fruit (sakhi anticipated me, because i love cabernet sauvignon!) from the very start, sahki was informative. we rented with another airbnb-er in ny, and he was so reassuring, since it was our first time using the site. he was readily available to answer any and all questions, from the most stupid to the most legitimate. in person, sakhi gives off an excellent and relaxed vibe. he didn't even get mad when i lost the house key on the third day! (which, of course, i replaced, but with no other penalties on me!)
as for downsides, there are only two. unfortunately, the week we booked with sakhi, he had no internet. coming from out of town (and out of country) this was slightly essential in researching activities. luckily, sakhi was ready and willing to gives all sorts of recommendations for bars, restaurants, lounges, nightlife, tourist sites and even travel options. there is also a public library down the street, where you can get a temporary pass to use the computers! sakhi also did his utmost to jack connections from his neighbors, so we were able to access some from outside.
number two, you can hear everything that goes on upstairs from the downstairs apartment...which i assume means it is likewise upstairs. it is an excellent spot for privacy, except when conversations wake you up from late morning sleep-in.
i was very pleased with the apartment. we had tons of food and cooking stuff to use at our disposal (of which we took full (website hidden by airbnb) many tv channels as well! and tons of space to relax from hot summer days.
thanks again, sakhi. my boyfriend doesn't speak english, and yet he was very comfortable with you as our host and in the apartment. i would stay here again."
145726,1950624,2012-08-11,1342962,Belinda,"this apartment is every bit as stylish and lovely as it looks in the photos. sakhi is a gracious host. the location is very nice. i like being able to stay in a neighborhood rather than a hotel complex. it's a short walk to the metro and a couple of grocery stores. 
i would stay here again."
145726,2024742,2012-08-18,3211559,Nisa,"sakhi was very accommodating and flexible, easy going, friendly, resourceful and helpful. the space was wonderfully neat and clean, aesthetically pleasing, all your needs in one---and exactly what i needed! i would be sure to recommend this spot, and even return next time i'm around."
145726,2183260,2012-09-03,5995,David,"i've had good experiences with airbnb stays, but this was my favorite experience.  sakhi's luraloft is truly a gem.  i was debating between staying at a nice hotel downtown versus the luraloft, and i'm very glad i chose the luraloft.  the use of space in the luraloft is exquisite.  everything is intelligently designed/placed to maximize the beautiful space.  as soon as you walk in you feel a warm, welcoming vibe that feels like home.  the place is *equipped* -- beautiful cork floors, a true spa bathroom/shower, fast wifi, directv with premium channels, a very comfortable queen bed, a modern kitchen, and even a washer/dryer round out a masterfully conceived unit.  also of great importance to me was the unzoned street parking directly out front of the unit.  dc is a very difficult city to park in (without getting parking tickets assaulted on you) --- so if you have  car, the luraloft is ideal for you.  located just off of the heart of petworth dc, the unit is perfectly located for my taste.  that is, it's in a quiet, residential area but is a very short drive from the heart of the city where all of the action is.  finally, sakhi was a  very responsive/professional host.  i like my privacy, and you will have ultimate privacy in the luraloft, but it's also great to know that sakhi is just a text message/phone call away in case you need anything.  can't recommend his place enough if you need a clean, modern, comfortable, and aesthetically dynamic custom unit that feels more like  a home than a hotel.  i hope to stay there every time i'm in dc, should i be lucky enough to have the place available.  "
145726,2494887,2012-10-03,3220860,Nicholas,"a really nice apartment.  the design of the place is amazing, very good use of space.  everything was very clean when we arrived, and sakhi even left us a bottle of wine and some food.

internet was reliable.  he recently upgraded it.

the floorboards above creak quite a bit, but you get used to it.  sakhi lives upstairs and is respectful and quiet.

the neighborhood is residential and pretty quiet.  great for travelers with a car, as there is plenty of street parking.  if you are carless, keep in mind that there aren't many grocery stores/restaurants around.  you will need to rely on walking (many blocks) or the bus.

my only real complaint is some of the area around the apartment, georgia ave, for example.  one of the only buses nearby, the 70, runs here.  it's not a nice street and you have people hanging out on the corners all day.  they never bothered me much besides incoherent yelling/cursing.  just ignore them and you'll be fine.
"
145726,2598123,2012-10-13,3679344,Alexander,sakhi was a fantastic host and the apartment was lovely. i was alone but it would have accomodated 2 easily. i'd come back any time.
145726,2699688,2012-10-24,3509151,Brad,"great place, nice and quiet.  a bit of a walk from metro, but bus line runs very near the apt. sakhi was a very considerate and responsive host. coudn't ask for better...."
145726,2802646,2012-11-04,3939081,Julien,"it was a very nice apartment, modernly decorated, clean and with some basic and sufficient cooking equipment. as described by other reviewers, sakhi was a great host; in particular, we found it thoughtful that he had left food for us when we arrived as we came in around 9pm. definitely worth the stop !"
145726,2905574,2012-11-18,3570636,Tracy,"the apartment is terrific, and exactly as described. it's comfortable, well-lit and cozy; it hardly feels like a basement apartment. the design and furnishing is very thoughtful, and anticipates all your needs, including some food and beverages to get you started (which was greatly appreciated!). the apartment is in a pleasant residential neighborhood, so it feels more like a temporary home away from home, not a sterile hotel (at twice the price). there are a few good restaurants in the area (domku is excellent, el torogoz is worth trying for salvadoran specialities, and fasika offers good ethiopian if not great atmosphere) and a nice organic market. the metro is a bit of a hike (which i enjoyed), but the bus is only a couple blocks away, if you'd rather not walk. and sakhi was a great host, prompt and accommodating, and just a very nice person. all in all, it was a great place to stay for nearly two weeks, and i'd happily stay again next time i'm in dc. plus, i got to play fetch with patches, sakhi's friendly dog, when i was missing my own. "
145726,2965298,2012-11-26,3731597,Leslie,"this lovely apartment was perfect for my needs during the week of thanksgiving, 2012.  my 17 year old daughter stayed with me and we were able to host my other daughter who lives near by for meals.  we were warm and comfortable and had great access to public transportation. i would highly recommend this to anyone needing a place to stay for a week or two in the d.c. area."
145726,3823368,2013-03-18,6967691,Mary Beth,"luraloft is clean, quiet, comfortable, and beautifully furnished.  there is a fine array of breakfast items, a bowl of fresh fruit, fully furnished kitchen, full-size washer and dryer, flat screen tv with cable, and fast wi-fi.  

we arrived after a day of travel and settled in for the evening.  we ordered indian take-out from fusion (seafood curry, crispy spinach salad) just three blocks away.

some of the reviews mention the neighborhood.  indeed, i don't relish late night travels in a strange city.  we managed just fine.  luraloft is in a quiet residential neighborhood of row houses, well-lit at night.  the georgia/petworth metro stop is about a mile walk.  coming back late, say midnight, we rode the #70 bus which dropped us just two blocks from the apartment.  one night, we caught the #70 at the georgia/petworth metro.  another night, we caught the bus at gallery place.

if you are familiar with washington dc, you know it takes time to visit monuments and museums.  we find we are out for the entire day.  it was nice to return to a comfortable apartment.

sakhi is a wonderful host, warm and friendly, helpful and concerned wit the comfort of his guests.  we would definitely recommend luraloft and would stay there again when in dc."
145726,3923164,2013-03-27,5185010,Gabrielle,"we really enjoyed sakhi's apartment. modernly decorated, quiet and clean place! 
sakhi was there to welcome us with a bowl of fresh fruits, some items in the fridge for breakfast and a good bottle of wine! such a great host!
15min of walk or buses will lead you to the subway station. the neighborhood is nice and beautiful. and not far of a forest and river!
we highly recommend sakhi's place!
"
145726,4086921,2013-04-08,480862,Jennifer L.,"luraloft is in a quiet residential neighborhood about three miles from downtown dc with ample unrestricted parking! the apartment though a basement is very well appointed. it is very clean with a washer/dryer. the bathroom is large with a large walk-in glass enclosed shower. there were goodies such as wine, fruits, juice etc. for our use. luraloft was sufficient for two adults. sakhi is a warm and friendly host who welcomed me as you would family. i would return and i highly recommend luraloft!"
145726,4107550,2013-04-10,5105483,Amy,"we stayed at sakhi's luraloft for 2 days during a recent trip to dc for the cherry blossom festival.  it is a great space, with just what we needed.  it looks just as it does in the pictures and the shower is fantastic!  sakhi was great to work with, very accommodating and was a pleasure to speak with.  you cannot go wrong with this apartment.  "
145726,4187620,2013-04-16,1621431,Victoria,"perfect abode! pictures don't lie. my friend and i had a great stay. although we never met sakhi checking in and checking out were very simple.  he was very helpful during our stay. also, he has a very cute pup! i would definitely recommend his place!  "
145726,4235042,2013-04-21,4729630,Juma,the apartment was exactly as shown on the pictures and it was also very clean and confortable. sakhi was very attentive and helpful all the time. everything was a very happy surprise!
145726,4323918,2013-04-28,4996966,Kaminie,sakhi was a great host! i have no complaints! he was attentive and very easy to get in contact with if i needed anything at all. i arrived late but he was very accomodating. the apartment is amazing! he has thought of everything! you won't regret staying here :)
145726,4520802,2013-05-10,4637843,Alison,"sakhi has created a great studio apartment in the basement of his house, resulting in a compact but highly functional space, with discrete areas for cooking, sleeping, relaxing, and working (small desk).  although it is in the basement, there are sufficient windows for it not to feel dungeon-like (the bathroom is particularly light-filled).  it was a very comfortable place and hit just the right balance of calm and creative, with spots of color in the kitchen and bathroom. kitchen has all amenities.  the apartment has ac and individual heat, and a full-size washer and dryer.  

sakhi is a very considerate host and provided careful and complete answers to all our pre-trip questions regarding transportation, stores, etc.  he had also pre-stocked the fridge with breakfast supplies and fruit, which was lovely.  everything was clean and in full working order.  luraloft is a good 20 minute walk to the subway but only a 10-minute walk to the main drag (georgia ave) with buses to the subway and downtown washington; there is also a capitol bikeshare station not far from the apartment.  there is a large organic supermarket near the subway as well as a specialty coffeehouse.  luraloft is on a quiet residential street of neat houses, although the broader neighborhood seems to be in transition, from poor to middle-class.  i walked around at night and and felt perfectly safe but it was noticeable.   

in summary, a fantastic airbnb and one i would happily return to, for the apartment's comfort; the host; and the overall value."
145726,4729469,2013-05-22,2622685,Kathy,"we absolutely enjoyed our stay with sakhi at the luraloft apartment.  he was a very gracious host.the apartment was very comfortable and we made very good use of the kitchen. there was never an issue finding parking on the street very close by. there was a metro stop within a 15 - 20 minute walk or if you wanted to park your car and take the metro the ft totten station was only a 10 - 15 min drive away which has a parking lot. very convenient. 

i would definitely stay there again the next time we have to go to the dc area.

sakhi, thanks for a wonderful stay.

steve & kathy"
145726,7421925,2013-09-19,8563669,Tobias,"sakhis place is realy nice. we enjoyed staying there. sakhi was a very nice host and provided us with all the information we needed. the apparement is nicely furnished. it is pretty close to busses and a citybike station. walking to the next subway takes about 15 minutes.

next time we come to dc, we will surely checkout if sakhis place is available!"
145726,7530484,2013-09-23,5995,David,"sakhi's luraloft continues to be my preference for stays in washington dc.  i've stayed there numerous times now and the quality is always consistent, as is the seamless check-in/check-out process.  sakhi is always very responsive and accommodating, and the place is so well-conceived with all the amenities (fast wifi, premium programming on the flat screen tv) to make you feel at home while on the road.  a true airbnb stand-out and more comfortable/equipped than most 4-star hotels in the area."
145726,8116113,2013-10-16,5597500,Rike,"sakhi's apartment is a great home - yes, home - in washington! we stayed for 10 days and really appreciated that everything was there - laundry, full kitchen, comfortable and clean bathroom, tv...- even spices for cooking! i also had to do some work during our stay and found it a good place to concentrate. the apartment is easy to reach once you get your head around public transport and even easier with a car - there was parking space available on the street every day during our stay. we only saw sakhi once, when we got there, he was really friendly and hospitable - i'm sure if we would have had questions he would have helped! this would be a great place for longer stays, too."
145726,8350369,2013-10-27,168888,Kim,"the place was great for a short stay with all the right amenities. it was immaculately clean and spotless, exactly the way i would want it. sakhi was a generous host having left us a bottle of wine, fruit and other breakfast goods. the place was spacious, location was perfect for our needs. a very quick drive from the best places in dc. there was a bit of noise from the upper floor as it's a basement apartment but nothing hugely distracting or annoying. i couldn't have asked for a more suitable space for studying, cooking and generally relaxing. thanks sakhi!"
145726,8469595,2013-11-01,1342962,Belinda,this is the most welcoming airbnb site i stay at. sakhi is a thoughtful host who cares about his guests.
150109,691104,2011-11-04,901685,Naomi,"steffanie's apartment in adams morgan is in a really good location for sight seeing, local bars and good food. 

quality food and drink places right around the corner! it's near public transport but also walking distance to the city, and all the monuments. 

nice view from the living area. understandably you just need to be respectful of her belongings. 

overall i would definitely recommend this place, especially based on value for location. "

150109,1065067,2012-03-31,332888,Yoni,"good apartment at a great location. the combination of large living area and patio was stellar. steffanie's attention to detail in her instructions was also good. everything went without a hitch.

while i usually try to stay closer to metro stops, the l2 bus right on the corner was a convenient substitute, taking me to several metro stops in no time.

would definitely stay here again."
150109,1597130,2012-06-30,2688138,Andrew,"this was a wonderful apartment in the heart of adams morgan. about a 10 minute walk to the dupont circle metro where you can take the red line to explore the city. a lot of restaurants, bars, and attractions near by. meridian hill park was super close as was a couple grocery stores. plenty of utensils to cook with, a great balcony to drink wine on, and overall a very clean apartment. steffanie was a great host as well. she was easy to get in touch with and very communicative. highly recommend!"

i know the location, as i have friends living nearby.  i parked in the driveway, no problem, which is great anywhere in dc.  

the room, up one flight of easy stairs, was charming, clean, spacious for one and the bed was comfortable.  i slept really, really well!  the house was very quiet.

the bath is shared, which i failed to note on booking, but this was not a problem, as it was very clean and 95 % available..  the shower was good with nice water pressure.  

i left at 11am  after first doing a load of laundry in natasha's modern, large washer/dryer.   very appreciated!

natasha and inna were very warm and welcoming.  they couldn't have been nicer.  they are both very quiet too.  this is not a party-house.  

i would stay here again happily and i recommend it highly.

153545,4797505,2013-05-26,6533399,Michael,natasha came through in a pinch.  i had to find a space in dc at the last minute and 12 hours after messaging natasha she was picking me up from the nearest metro station.  would repeat if i'm back in the dc area.

153545,6408376,2013-08-11,7871924,Merry,lovely home in a picturesque neighborhood!  natasha was a gracious host- offering to drive me to and from the metro station twice daily!  i had coffee every morning with her and enjoyed my conversations.  (she also offered food but had breakfast and lunch at the institute i was attending at the smithsonian.)  a comfortable room with a view- it was definitely better and safer than a hotel.  i wish i had been able to visit the nearby park but the weather was a little warm... maybe next time!!
155859,396271,2011-07-25,815386,La' Trishia,"our 4 day, 3 night stay with larry and paulette was extremely pleasant! they were wonderfully attentive and hospitable hosts, providing us with daily breakfast, transit passes, and several suggestions about local attractions. we didn't have to worry about a thing, because larry and paulette had it covered. the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was beautiful. the shower was my favorite thing! plus they provided shampoo, very good soap, and plenty of towels. 

we fell in love with their pets lulu the social cat and ramon, the music-loving, jig-dancing parrot. there was a third cat, blackie, that we nevr saw, but neither of the pets were bothersome...we are pet owners so we enjoyed the extra company. 

we highly recommend larry and paulette's b&b. they are both down-to earth, eclectic, world traveled people with wonderful spirits! you are sure to feel welcome!"
155859,412531,2011-08-01,439910,Lisa,"i stayed with larry and paulette for a week when i first moved to the area and was looking for an apartment.  they made what could have been a very stressful transition week very enjoyable!  from recommendations on restaurants, to driving directions, to even help searching for apartments, they bent over backwards to make me feel comfortable.  i would highly recommend their accomodations to any potential guests!"
155859,425858,2011-08-07,623998,Michael,"paulette & larry were delightful hosts.  paulette was like a big sister, attentive and always making sure that our stay was as pleasant as she could make it.  their hospitality was really something and we felt immediately ralaxed in sharing their home which was tastefully decorated and comfortable.  paulette was extremely helpful with all the logistics of visiting d.c. and we  shared many enjoyable conversations with them both."
155859,580640,2011-09-29,937493,Naomi And Joe,"paulette and larry were great hosts. snacks at the end of the day with wine and conversation and breakfst in the morning. one morning she had left us a note that she had went out to catch a bus to buy fresh bagels. helpful with transportation tips and a starting metro card to use to get on the bus and directions for topping it up. very comfortable bed the best i had slept in on our 2 week trip. larry helped my husband get his computer to connect with their internet access.
a very comfortable and positive experience."
155859,603154,2011-10-06,799046,Andrew & Jackie,"forget other hosts that claim to be 'superhosts' or airbnb, larry and paulette really are the real thing.  the quality of care and attention to detail started a long time before we arrived in washington. they contacted us before our arrival to see what we would like to eat for breakfast and if we had any special dietary requirements.  the room is super cosy and comfortable with great linens and nice towels to use. there is ample hanging space and the wifi connection is brilliant.  breakfast time was an absolute pleasure with paulatte always eager to please and provide us with a varied menu. the location was spot on for what we needed, there was always lots of free parking on the road outside and if we needed the metro iit was about fifteen minutes walk away via avert nice and safe neighbouhood.  paulette and larry also provided us with metro cards that enabled us to cheaper rail fares.  we had a great time and would recommend  larry and paulette to stay with, we would definitely return and hopefully will one day.
thank you for such a wonderful time on our last stop on our world tour. "
155859,648846,2011-10-20,851485,Juan,"paulette was unbelievable nice. she cooked, offered wine and was a great resource during my trip. a lot of attention to detail. i couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. the place is comfortable, conveniently located and  clean. a+!!! "

155859,789049,2011-12-16,1502608,Michael,"they were very flexible with my check-in/out times. 

i checked in the morning around 10 am and they had breakfast (pancakes, bacon, fresh fruit, juice) and coffee for me upon my arrival. 

the bedroom is nice and quiet. pets were quiet and didn't enter the guest room.

they supplied a smartrip metro card, metro maps, bus schedules, neighborhood aquatic center, local gym info, gallery brochures and restaurant menus, city paper and a list of special events for the dates of my stay. they explained how to use the metro card and had a brochure which explained how to load money onto the card and how it's used for both train and bus travel. they also showed me how to use different apps and online features to find out when times for the next train or bus or fastest trip plan to get around town.

i was also able to do a little work from their house. internet service was fast and i didn't have any connectivity issues. i was able to use their printer. when charging my cell they were happy to let me use their house phone.

the weather was nice during my stay. about a 15 minute walk to metro. paulette reminded me that if i had time i should visit the national portrait gallery which was a few blocks from my meeting for work.

when i arrived back late at night, larry and paulette were kind enough to invite me to have wine. watched a couple movies on their tv.

paulette had off from work and was able to cook breakfast for me again.  afterwards i was able to go sight-seeing. larry and paulette helped me with my itinerary so i could get the most done on my last day. i was able to get around by train and bus easily from their location to the white house, national mall and smithsonian museum.

neighborhood is nice and quiet. on my day of departure they let me leave my luggage and personal belongings while i went sight-seeing. this way i was able to check out in the evening.

i had a great time and hope to be their guest again. i recommend them highly. larry and paulette were both friendly, warm and helpful. i couldn't have asked for better hosts."
155859,924888,2012-02-16,1601824,Samay,"we stayed here feb 2012 and it was great!  the hospitality was amazing.  paulette was like our personal assistant - even though we really did not expect it.  she provided metrocards, maps, bus schedules, directions above and beyond what we asked.  we could walk to the bus stop which went to the metro, or walk further/drive to the metro (a few min drive away).  we also went for runs in the nearby park (walking distance).  prior to the trip, we were asked if we had and dietary restrictions for breakfast and i mentioned we were vegan and gluten free - but not to worry as we usually just get food on our own.  paulette looked up every food company available online, and we had vegan gluten free delicious waffles and cereal, along with almond/rice milk!  the home is clean, cozy and inviting - and it was great to just chill out in the family room.  we enjoyed the parrot and 2 cats."
155859,1006591,2012-03-17,1662781,Jane,"i arrived from new zealand at 10.00pm and was created by paulette on my arrival who was inviting and pleasant. paulette showed me all i needed to know to get settled in comfortably then allowed me to go about my way to settle for the night.  paulette and larry's place is clean and comfortable and i loved my room, it was clean, airy with a lovely fan and the bed was so comfortable, it was a new bed and the mattress was   lovely to lie on. i slept like a baby every night.  i had my own bathroom with organic and natural products available to use.  paulette and larry have a cleaner that comes weekly so the house is clean and tidy.
i fell in love with both cats and they loved me :) and was entertained by their parrot who was funny to listen to.  i was not interrupted by the parrot at night and only heard him during the day which was lovely and funny to listen to.
the location was great as it was out of the city centre but only 4 miles away from it.  the rocky creek park was just around the corner and i ran and cycled in their everyday.  there is a road winding its way in the park to the other side of town to the city centre and was a very pleasant way to get to the city.  the local bus and train service were excellent if you chose to take it as i did on one occasion and it only took 20 minutes to get to the heart of the city.  larry and paulette went out their way to ensure i was catered for and provided for.  i had several problems connecting my laptop and larry was exceptionally helpful on this to help me out.  paulette  ensured i had all the directions i needed to head to the city for sightseeing trips and went shopping for organic produce for me especially as i am a raw foodist and i was thankful for this having a fridge full of produce for breakfast smoothies.
there was a nice garden at the back to sit at some table and chairs and relax in the sun with a shade umbrella, big enough to accommodate at least 5 people.
definitely recommend staying  with paulette and larry for a comfortable, private and convenient place to stay."
155859,1130655,2012-04-15,1642490,MaLeah,"staying with larry and paulette was the best decision i made for my trip to dc. they were so helpful and accommodating. transportation was very easy to get downtown. paulette went out of her way to make sure i had an amazing time in dc. i had really early mornings and late nights. they were always around with a warm, friendly smile. i was able to experience more of the city while staying with them. paulette also showed me around on my last day and took me out to a great dinner.  i felt like i was staying with close friends/ family. i would highly recommend staying with larry and paulette! i know i will not stay anywhere else!"

155859,1440316,2012-06-08,1802014,Natália,"i loved my experience at larry and paulette's place. i made a last-minute reservation and paulette replied almost immediately. the house is very charming and the room is perfect. i had a bathroom only for me, which was very convenient. 

i also loved the fact that they offer breakfast and paulette was really kind to give a lot of options before i arrived so that she could prepare it! amazing!

the house is not far from the subway station - a 15-minute walk or 5-minute bus ride (and there is a bus every 20 or 30 minutes)."
155859,1600556,2012-07-01,2133336,Molly Chandler,paulette and larry are wonderful hosts.  the room was perfect and it was really nice having a private bath.  they were both very helpful with advice on getting around dc and even lent me a smarttrip card to use while i was there.  the location is convenient for both the metro and the metrobus and is in a nice neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and stores nearby.  they include delicious breakfast with great coffee and convenient snacks . staying with them is truly an enjoyable experience and i highly recommend them to anyone coming to dc. 
155859,1775262,2012-07-23,2133336,Molly Chandler,"another great two weeks in dc, i was in town for an extended period of time for a summer internship and paulette and larry continued to be gracious hosts and make sure that i was as comfortable as possible.  if i find myself back in dc i would not hesitate to stay with them again. 
"
155859,2085353,2012-08-24,3263216,Kyle,"the house was in a quiet neighborhood which was really nice.  the bed was really comfortable.  paulette was very helpful in offering information and assistance.  they always offered tasty snacks and treats throughout the stay.  they provided smartrip cards which are very useful in getting around town using the metro and bus lines.  it was nice to have a private room and private bathroom with supplied with everything you'd need and clean linen and towels.  it was my first time ever using airbnb and they made it an easy process, much easier than i would've thought.  i am glad i chose larry and paulette's listing as my first time--i will definitely use airbnb in the future."
155859,2354518,2012-09-20,1583722,Tyler,"recommend - 4 good reasons:
1. bike included for free with rental.
2. plenty of snacks available.
3. very comfortable bed!
4. regular housekeeping service."
155859,2476410,2012-10-01,3575135,Gladys,"i would recommend paulette and larry's place to anyone. i stayed with them for a week while looking for a more permanent place in the dc area. not only was it very easy for me to get to downtown dc by way of the express bus what really made the stay worth it was the care and attention i received during my stay. paulette was quick to help me with anything i needed from directions, suggestions of where to get a flat tire, or taking the time to help my search for an apartment and offering to accompany me. the room i stayed in was very comfortable and clean and had everything i needed and more, including delicious snacks that were great while walking around dc or for a lunch on the go. my private bathroom was just outside my bedroom door and was also very clean and had everything i needed in it from shampoo and face wash to shaving cream and floss. she also shared with me many meals and glasses of  wine while we watched tv and chit chatted. another plus was their friendly pets, they brought me plenty of comfort and entertainment, ramon the parrot  was especially fun to watch and even though he would sometimes talk while i was downstair i never heard him at night when i was in my room. over all i had a great experience at paulette and larry's and will definitely check with them first the next time i need a place to stay."
155859,2605289,2012-10-14,3558918,Kate,"overall, this spot provides a great value for the price. the bedroom and bathroom are as advertised - clean and comfortable. while the express bus made it easy to get downtown, it took me at least 45 minutes from the house to the white (website hidden by airbnb) location-wise, it was a bit out of the way for my needs. the neighborhood has little to offer in terms of around-the-corner conveniences/charm. 

that said, paulette and larry were gracious hosts - going above and beyond to make sure i had all i needed to be comfortable and get situated. we had fun watching a presidential debate together. : ) and, if you're at all into sports/getting fresh air, rock creek park is right around the corner which is a huge asset! the snacks are also a nice touch. "
155859,3010896,2012-12-02,4258863,Irene,"do yourself a favor and stay with larry and paulette.  you will not be sorry.  first and foremost they are wonderful to be around, they make you feel right at home and part of their family....that includes the cats and the parrot.  they know their city and the ins and outs, to say nothing of providing us with a smart pass.  when you are new to an area this kind of information and caring can't be bought, they give it willingly.  we were selling our home across county and found ourselves in a situtation where we needed to have some documents printed,signed, notorized, etc. larry and paulette jumped right in and printed them for us, scanned our documents and helped us be able to ""close the deal"".  they didn't need to do that but they didn't think twice about helping. this is a safe house and a safe neighborhood.  we were able to take the bus/metro to every place we wanted to go,it was an easy process even for someone not familiar with the system.  plus....their snacks are awesome :  )"
155859,3405768,2013-01-24,4244467,Shelly,"from the minute we arrived at the baltimore airport, paulette was waiting to drive us to her home for a wonderful inaugural experience in the ""guest nest.""  both larry and paulette were welcoming and went out of their way to provide us with everything we needed to enjoy our stay in dc.  they cooked a wonderful breakfast each morning based upon what we had requested, drove us to so many different locations in dc (which was not easy with all the closed streets for security).  they recommended local restaurants which all seemed exceptional and we enjoyed a great nepalese indian meal in the takoma park area.  paulette was very helpful with directions within the dc area, subway connections, and the goodies in our room with fresh flowers made us feel special.  the bed was very comfortable and the private bathroom was equipped with anything you would need.  their place is not in the heart of dc but if  you want a quiet nights sleep, it is perfect.  downtown dc is easily reached with a 10 minute metro ride.  thanks for a great first airbnb experience.  shelly and marc"
155859,3777511,2013-03-13,5326095,Dirceu,"larry and paulette are a amazing hostess couple. they are so friendly and helped in everything! its very easy to take bus and metro and the breakfast was the best part of the day!

155859,3963358,2013-03-31,218284,Anna,"larry an paulette were wonderful hosts and helpful in every way.
the room was very nice and the bed really comfortable. everything was supplied even chocolate and energy bars in the room, which was great. breakfast was served every morning.paulette had 
found out what i wanted for breakfast and i really appreciated that. the cats and the parrot were wonderful. the cats were very private. you could make friends with them or not.  the house was filledl with wonderful photos and art objects. a wonderful place to stay ! "
155859,4067290,2013-04-07,5544952,Sylvia,"thanks for larry and paulette for their warm hospitality. i had never been to washington dc before. the accommodation was great, and their knowledge of the city was very helpful."
155859,4185462,2013-04-16,5396374,Karin,"staying with paulette and larry is what made my stay in dc so great. the room and bathroom is bright, beautiful and lovingly decorated, verything is provided for and they go out of their way to make sure you have all you need. there are bikes available, which is a great way to get around dc and the surrounding areas. breakfast includes anything you heart and stomach may desire. paulette and larry really welcomes you to their house and makes you feel at home. they go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. the way they welcomed me is the reason why my stay in dc was such a nice one. i would absolutely stay with them again!"
155859,4224146,2013-04-20,358133,Jeff,"comfortable stay.  paulette sets up a nice breakfast - with good coffee, healthy cereals, juices, etc.  dedicated bathroom is a real plus, especially since i was attending a conference downtown.  no problem getting up early when i had to, or sleeping in when i wanted.  slept much better here than in any standard hotel.

location is a bit out of core dc - yet great public transportation gets you where you need to go.  nearby takoma/takoma park is a 15 min walk with a neighborhood collection of shops and places to eat.

also a plus is nearby rock creek park, where you can walk or jog through the trees or along the river."

every time love to go back. highly recommended"
155859,4759051,2013-05-24,5610179,Gayle - Jim,"while most hosts are helpful and informative, paulette goes well beyond the ‘call of duty’.  on our return visit to washington, paulette was ready with suggestions and made a special trip for us to visit the iwo jima memorial. it was the highlight of our trip. 
as we were not driving, she gave detailed instructions for city transit, bus schedules and arranged for her ‘taxi service’ to the train station. 
paulette pays attention to her guests with breakfast menu items to suit their taste.
thanks for sharing paulette and larry.

155859,4866084,2013-05-29,6321549,Jessica,"larry and especially paulette are great hosts and took good care of us. we stayed four days at their house. every day we got a delicous breakfast before we took of to downtown washington dc with their two bikes. dc is a great city to ride by bike. it took us about 25 min to get to the white house and there is a very nice bike path through the rock creek park which takes you right to the arlington cemetary. 
thank you for everything, we had a wonderful time!"
155859,4954055,2013-06-03,5291048,Justin,larry and paulette were great hosts. i really enjoyed staying there and the communication between them and their guests was very transparent. the parking available was awesome as well as all of the little things they helped provide to make sure my stay was enjoyable. 5 stars!
155859,5308119,2013-06-24,5325747,Allegra,"public review:
our visit to washington d.c. was at the tail end of a four week vacation.  it wasn't until we arrived home to several lengthy and frantic messages that we realized paulette had been calling and texting our home phone for arrival time rather than our cell.  (apparently airbnb only gave one phone number to the host.)  prior to arriving we made arrangements for paulette to pick us up at the airport, since our car rental was set for the following day.  upon arriving at her home, however, we discovered that our room was on the second floor which was not ideal, given our back problems.   we were willing to overlook this issue until we checked into our room, and realized that it was too small and cluttered for comfort.  larry is a photographer and we realized that the photos on the website were a bit misleading.  the site shows more than one bedroom, neither of which was exactly the room we were given. the site also did not indicate that the bedroom and bath were on the second floor.  we phoned airbnb and their advice was “to work it out”.  at that point, and while paulette was away visiting, larry stated that “it was his house” and that we were not to count on paulette for resolution.  we decided to stay, and paulette did everything to make our visit pleasant.  we were there a week and paulette (who i wish would put her photo on the airbnb site) more than lives up to her reputation.  she is exceedingly accommodating and went out of her way to make our stay pleasant.  the breakfasts she prepares with fresh fruit, organic milk, tea, cereals of your choice are lovely and filling.  one noted issue was the fresh sliced tomatoes paulette served with breakfast (which my husband is severely allergic to.)  her cats are friendly, and the parrot a showstopper.  sitting on the porch around sundown we were treated to a spectacular show of lightening bugs, something we hadn't seen since childhood.   a “heads up” on car rentals.  we used the howard enterprise on georgia ave. they picked us up at paulette's and were reasonable, flexible, friendly, and accommodating.  we wanted to experience driving a kia soul and they went out of their way to procure one for us.  another tidbit is to try yo! sushi at union station. we found their personal stations quite brilliant, and a step up from the usual conveyor belt themes."
155859,6049669,2013-07-28,6933408,Kevin,it was a very pleasant stay. paulette and larry are really nice people and are more than happy to share their advice and suggestions about things to do in dc/how to get your destinations.
155859,6681738,2013-08-21,4813905,Weronika,"paulette and larry are truly exceptional people. they are very friendly and welcoming. we had a wonderful stay at their place. they made sure that everything is perfect. the room and bathroom are very clean and confortable. we had delicious breakfasts. we had the opportunity to dine with paulette and larry, we had wonderful diner! they put at our disposal bikes which allowed us to really explore the city, in a nice way and to save money. we highly recommend this 5 star airbnb place to stay. "
155859,7183030,2013-09-09,5838011,Matt,larry and paulette were more than accommodating.  they have plenty of information if you are in the dc area for the night or the week.  nice people and would stay with them again.

155859,8712250,2013-11-12,4374370,Randall,"i had a great stay with larry and paulette for 10 days.  it was my first airbnb stay, but i think it will be difficult to find hosts like them again.  i left early and came home late, and it was never a problem.  the bathroom was stocked with anything you could need, there were snacks and water in the room, and high speed wifi.  

the house is really nice - a big front porch, interesting decorations, and shady trees on a nice safe street with easy access to a frequently running bus that took me straight downtown.  the metro is a bit of a longer walk, but the bus worked great.  

on top of that, they are really just outstanding people - they would take care of you in whatever you would need, or they would give you all the privacy you would want.  i can't really imagine better hosts.  if you want to stay a little outside the tourist district of the city, stay here.  "
160148,879013,2012-01-23,1570050,Katya,dana is a lovely and present host. she was helpful at all times and the place was kept clean and warm throughout my stay!
160597,1280916,2012-05-14,770664,Heather,i stayed in this farmhouse for a week in may. it is a quaint home over 100 years old that feels similar to a traditional b&b. the house has been well maintained with modern updates in the kitchen and bathroom. the bedroom was large enough to fit my luggage and other belongings without it being cramped. its on a beautiful street near a bus stop that can be used to get into dc easily. the hostess was the friendliest of any with whom i have stayed. very attentive to every need. i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to a friend.

160597,1445523,2012-06-09,2478641,Laina,"i went to washington d.c. for a professional conference and stayed for five nights.  elizabeth was an exceptional host.  she accommodated a few arrival and departure schedule changes, which was much appreciated, since these were unanticipated when i first reserved.  elizabeth's home is charming and the bed in her guest room is very comfortable.  her home is located close to the bus stop, where you can take a bus that goes right into downtown d.c.   the neighborhood is quiet and safe.  it is about a 20 min bus ride, with no transfers to george washington university, where my conference was held. a public library, a safeway grocery store and a starbucks coffee shop are all within walking distance.  i hope that elizabeth has availability the next time i come to d.c., because her place is my first choice on where to stay in the district."

175581,553781,2011-09-21,938931,Colin,"molly & gregory were very good hosts.
although they were not in when we first arrived, as they were away for a few days prior to our arrival, they got in touch as soon as they got back.
i had shared a few emails with molly before we flew out, so knew how to get in and full intructions as what to do.
they had made sure that we had some grocery provisions and drinks in the fridge and a bottle of good wine.
we thought that was such a thoughtfull thing to do, as well as all the toiletries we could possibly need.
when we did meet up we were asked if we needed anything to make our stay more comfortable,and molly baked us a delicious ginger cake.
they had a very lively young dog called sally, who was no problem at all, who like most dogs loved plenty of attension.
the apartment was so central to everything, either a good 25 min walk, or the metro right across the street to save the feet to the capitol building.
the whole experience was very good, and the cost was very reasonable for the faclities.
and we would really recommend molly & gregorys apartment."

best regards,

175581,614646,2011-10-10,783627,Siobhan,"molly and greg and sally the dog were great hosts. molly went out of her way to help us on our arrival to the extent of picking us up from the car hire drop off.
the apartment has great facilities, including full laundry and cooking and is also very private. 
the location is very convenient with excellent public transport links and a great grocery store nearby. the location also seemed very safe and we never had any concerns about our personal safety in the area.
only downside was unreliable wifi but that was the isp's fault and not our hosts! 
well done molly, we will recommend you to our australian friends."

the apartment itself is great -- really well-appointed, fabulously clean, stocked with snacks and some condiments. even coffee and tea for the morning! they've thought of everything. great desk for working if you need to and the bedroom is quiet and comfortable. lovely bathroom and shower as well as a washer and dryer. very handy! 

the location can't be beat -- yes, it's not right downtown, but it's literally 15 minutes by train to practically anywhere. so get yourself a metro pass and start tooling around the city and then come back to the coziest little apartment ever and relax after a long day. "

thank you so much for sharing a part of your home with us.  when we arrived in a taxi on the street in front of your home, gregory came out to greet us and help us with the heavy luggage.  he introduced us to your dog sally and gave us a quick but comprehensive tour of the unit.  we felt like we are family to you. 

the unit is spacious with separate bedroom, bathroom, living area and kitchen.  you even stocked the kitchen with little treats for us.  we had our own access to the unit so we don’t disturb you too much when we return late in the evening.

we would love to come back here again and will definitely recommend this unit to our friends and family.

we so enjoy you hospitality.

175581,1579105,2012-06-28,1776242,Ross & Patsy,"we enjoyed eight nights here. the apartment is well appointed even with a little study area. molly and greg were away on arrival but had left good instructions for us. when they returned they immediately met any needs. 

it was wonderfully close to the metro and only a few minutes from the city. there was a very good super market two minutes away. 

we will recommend this to friends. "
175581,1634705,2012-07-05,2285852,Lauren,"such a lovely apartment, and an excellent place to stay when exploring dc.  the space was comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. the location was excellent- so close to the subway, bike rental station and a great supermarket. molly and gregory are also wonderful hosts.

175581,2388073,2012-09-24,96503,Richard,"firstly, we fully endorse the favourable reviews of both the hosts and the apartment .
molly and greg were very helpful and of assistance when required.
 
 the apartment was as described and well located. a large supermaket was nearby ,as was the metro.( as seniors ,we were able to obtain reduced fares by getting a special pass-obtainable at the metro centre station ).

the capitol building itself was within a reasonable  walking  distance.
 however it is better to use the metro and reserve your energy for walking between the sites.

having a good washer/dryer was a bonus as we could do a complete laundry before travelling on to our next city

the start -up provisions ,including milk,  tea, cereals  and soft drinks etc  were very welcome.

we would wholehartedly recommend the apartment

175581,2434289,2012-09-28,1591210,Tim,great location in central washington dc.  molly and gregory are great hosts.  close to all attraction and subway right near by is a huge bonus.

dear molly and gregory, thanks for all :-)"
175581,2776092,2012-11-01,2693317,Rene,"we had to spend much more time in the apartment than we had planned to (we weren't able to go out for day and a half due to the sandy storm) and the apartment had everything we need; is comfortable, clean, and in a great location: one block from the metro station –and a short ride to all the city attractions–, and one block from the supermarket.
molly and greg are great hosts, they have for us some snacks and soda in the fridge, metro cards, and a lots of map and guides to the city. molly even shared with us a delicious freshly-made pumpkin bread.
we definitely would return.

175581,3003007,2012-12-01,3162786,Sei,"my husband and i really enjoyed our stay here, and the next time we're in dc, we will look to stay here again. molly and gregory clearly care about their guests, and they've stocked the nicely appointed apartment with little extras that cater to guests' comfort, like snacks on the kitchen counter and cold drinks in the fridge. being in the basement, there were some telecom quirks -- the wi-fi was a bit slow and my t-mobile phone coverage was patchy, but these were minor issues that we were able to work around. and having the apartment so close to the grocery store and metro station was a big plus. we were able to come in from dulles by bus and then metro, even with two big bags, saving us at least $50 on cab fare. if you stay here, you must stop by mangialardo & sons, only a few minutes' walk, for a take-out sandwich (i liked the g-man and my husband was partial to the pizza sub). "
175581,3083402,2012-12-13,3460252,Sarah,"molly and greg were fantastic hosts. we met them both upon arriving to the apartment and they were incredibly nice. the apartment was perfect for our 3 night stay, especially the location, and even came with drinks, snacks, and laundry detergent. a couple things came up and they immediately responded to our needs. there were also smartrip cards available for the metro. they were also very flexible to our arrival and check out times. i would definitely recommend them for your stay in dc. "
175581,3379443,2013-01-20,1895276,Heather,"i was recommended by a close friend that this was  a great airbnb to say in while i was on business in washington dc. it is practically across the street from the metro, the harris teeter is a block over which makes it super easy to really use their full kitchen. the apartment is new and very comfortable. it was just like staying in my own house. there also great little goodies like oatmeal and tea for breakfast, snacks and loads of ""see washington"" tour books. i highly recommend! "
175581,3422721,2013-01-27,4018865,Chris,"molly and greg have a wonderful apartment in dc. they have furnished it with everything you could ever need and it really feels like home. they were very fast to accomodate my requests. the local grocery store quickly became a favorite and many things are close by.

the apartment is sunny for a basement apartment and not very much has been forgotten. the snacks and sodas are a nice addition.  

my few complaints are that the off street parking isn't ideal and requires a parking pass that took several days to get since i didn't alert them before. the location is good, but i would have preferred to be a few blocks closer to the capitol.

great for 1 or 2 people and is a great place to stay to get around dc like a local. "
175581,3463527,2013-02-03,3932856,Patrick,"we spent four perfect nights in molly & gregory's apartment. i cannot recommend this place highly enough - the kitchen is modern and fully stocked, the place is clean and fully furnished, the bathroom is spacious, the bed is comfy, and the heating was just right for our whole stay. 

the location couldn't be better. it's a quiet and well kept area. you're a five minute walk from a good supermarket, and a five minute walk to the train station which will get you anywhere in the city with ease.

molly & gregory were very nice and welcoming - in fact, molly managed to find me a pair of bolt cutters when one of my locks jammed on my baggage! check-in and check-out was a breeze, and communication was prompt and easy.

i know where we'll be staying when we come back to dc :)"
175581,3661045,2013-03-01,4084222,Tamara,"molly and gregory are very friendly hosts. very relaxed and accommodating. we stayed in the apartment for a month and had everything we needed (dishwasher, washer and dryer, well-functioning wifi, smart cards for the metro etc). the bedroom gets more sun than you would expect for a basement apartment (nice morning sun). the bathroom has a high-pressure and spacious shower. the isolation could be better (you hear occasional footsteps from the floor above) but if you are out visiting the city all day, this doesn't matter very much. for us, the vicinity to the metro stop (literally 1 minute away), turned out to be very important and convenient. "
175581,3774912,2013-03-13,242637,Ann,"the apartment and the paglia's are great. the location is perfect. traveling alone, safety is always a concern and i felt very safe coming home late in the evening or leaving in the dark in the morning. the metro is so close. there is also a great grocery store around the corner. i walked to the eastern market as well as to the capitol. i will definitely try to stay here again. the apartment is very comfortable. "
175581,3852133,2013-03-21,3952441,Kace&Tamir,"molly and greg were wonderful hosts who really went the extra mile. not only was the flat clean and cozy, but also molly went out of her way to take care of all the little details to give us the beat trip ever (metro cards were left on the table, snacks, books on washington dc). 
we highly recommend, they are lovely and the flat is wonderful. "
175581,3886095,2013-03-25,4433286,Natascha,molly & gregory are the most wonderful hosts you can imagine! they made us feel very welcome and made sure that our three day stay at washington d.c. was perfect. their apartment was perfectly located for exploring the city. the metro station is just steps away and for those using the fully equipped kitchen there are two well stocked supermarkets just around the corner.
175581,4041657,2013-04-05,2217216,Wendy,"we had a fantastic time in dc. the apt.is perfect! across the street from a great grocery store, and directly across the street from the metro. 
unfortunately, greg and molly had a family emergency right before we arrived so we did not get to meet them. molly was incredibly accommodating. she had her friend get a parking pass for us, which we had within 2 hours of arriving in dc., and had a friend available in case we needed anything. the apt. was spotless, stocked with snacks, coffee, condiments in the frig, etc. everything you need/can think of is in the apt. it could not have been more perfect....except we missed meeting the family, and the dog!   :-) 
i highly recommend this apt. to anyone visiting dc. 
thanks gregory and molly! will catch you next time!

175581,4093415,2013-04-09,4769287,Elizabeth,"the apartment was clean and well equipped. the position was fantastic -- an easy walk to capitol hill and a short walk to the nearby local markets. after travelling for a while it was great to be able to cook meals and wash and dry our clothes. while the apartment is in the basement it was warm however there is evidence of rising damp. my only complaint and it is significant, is the bed. be warned it is only a double bed and not particularly comfortable. i had to sleep on a blow up bed which certainly wasn't ideal. also if you are a light sleeper footsteps could be heard from above however the hosts did keep noise to the minimum. we only briefly  met our hosts at the end of our stay; they were delightful and helpful."
175581,4145420,2013-04-14,4898593,Nicola-Jane,"molly and gregory were very welcoming and their basement flat was well appointed and spacious.  the location is great - just 5 minutes walk from the metro which is only a few stops from the city centre.  molly and gregory had thoughtfully provided smartrip cards which gave us a discount on our metro tickets. we arrived in an unseasonal heatwave and were lucky to coincide with the amazing cherry blossom festival too. 

the apartment had everything we needed and it was very useful to be able to do some laundry after a couple of weeks away from home!

this was our very first air bnb experience, thanks to the whole family for making it so memorable! "
175581,4202165,2013-04-18,4854884,Jennifer,"molly and greg were great, very accommodating and very timely with their responses to my questions.
the location is good in dc literally right around the corner from the metro and right down the road from capitol hill.
the place was clean and very lovely.  our time was short and mostly related to business but we would stay with molly and greg again for sure!

175581,4265190,2013-04-23,4700762,Sandra,"molly & greg were good hosts. they tried to please us and we appreciate it very much.  the unit was very comfortable.  best of all was the location, a block from the metro and harris teeter grocery store. lots of info about washington and metro cards. while we were there, the temperature (weather dropped 20 degrees).there is no thermostat in the basement apartment. the air is regulated by molly & greg from their apartment. everyone likes their room temperature at different settings.  we felt cold at times and warm at other times.  it would have been nice to have are own thermostat. the tv worked fine, but the remote did not. you had to scroll up or down to change channels. you could not jump from one channel to another. best of all we felt we saved a lot of money, by eating in, parking our car, and taking the metro. it was a great place for a short stay. we would recommend it as a good place to stay while visiting washington dc. just remember  location, location, location and that's the whole story. 

"
175581,4659096,2013-05-19,169477,Karen,"exceptional value

one of my favorite places i have stayed at in d.c.  molly and greg are lovely people and they a lovely apartment where you can enjoy every creature comfort for a short or extended stay.  

dc is a difficult city to get around in.  having the subway so close is a tremendous convenience as is free parking when you have to have a car.  i liked being able to do a load of laundry, too.  

no travel experience is perfect and you may regret not having the beautiful views a hotel can offer but for the money, i don't think you could do much better.  
"
175581,4768351,2013-05-25,4957206,Mel & Glenn,"great spot to access everything washington has to offer.
molly and greg left us snacks and sodas as well as the use of a discount card for the nearby supermarket which saved us a lot of money.
metro passes were also there for us to use which can save you $5 pp.
only a $10 cab ride o union station too.
really great overall."
175581,4885309,2013-05-31,4692503,Sarah,"this is a cute little basement apartment in an excellent location.  it was less than a block to the metro and a grocery store (note to those not from this area - the grocery store is called harris teeter which really threw us for a minute *grin*).   there was also a pizza place directly across the road.  the metro made it very easy to get around, especially to the national mall area where we spent almost all our time. 

all in all, we'd definitely stay here again and would recommend to others!  "
175581,6987948,2013-09-02,3737711,Nathan,"molly and gregory were completely hospitable and understanding to our unique situation.  they were both readily available and checked in on us numerous times.  we would recommend their place for its easy access to harris teeter, eastern market, and the metro.  in fact, we hope to stay again soon when we are back in the area!"
175581,7271080,2013-09-14,5474142,Margaret,"fantastic apartment clean comfortable and in a brilliant location very close to metro station buses and a harris teeter supermarket that sells everything including fab takeout foods. little extras provided by the hosts including  rechargeable metro smartrip cards, cans of soda and crisps very welcome. as brits visiting dc for the first time it was lovely to have somewhere like this to come back to each evening to relax and chill out after a full day sightseeing. very good wifi also provided, and washer/dryer to do laundry during the stay if wanted. molly and gregory were very friendly and keen to make sure we had everything we needed without interfering. molly also very helpful before our visit replying promptly to several requests for info to help us plan our trip, transfer from dulles airport etc. a great first experience using airbnb will certainly use again and would fully recommend this property and airbnb to others.

the kitchen fittings were very good, and there were also treats such as snacks, breakfast cereals, soft drinks, coffee etc waiting for us. having an excellent washer and dryer was a real bonus.
molly and gregory were great hosts and so friendly. if you want a good place to stay in dc, it would be hard to find something better."
175581,7848372,2013-10-06,1666270,Clive,"we had a great time in molly and gregory's garden apartment. there was just the perfect amount of interaction with them, we were welcomed by molly daughter and staffie on arrival and briefly chatted with gregory on departure and left to our own devices in between. the whole apartment was well appointed and some thoughtful touches like the discount card for the local supermarket and the metro cards. the supermarket harris teeter is arguably the best we ever experienced. we deduced from the visitors book comments that there was on offer more help and assistance if guests needed it . the location was perfect for us: walkable distance to the centre passed some good eating and drinking joints around 8th and close to the metro for quick returns later in the day. we arrived the day the us govt closed down so many of the things we wanted to visit (smithsonian, lincoln) were closed. worth another visit is the newseum which was open, we only went there on our last day and could have spent another day there. we will have to return and know where we would like to stay on that next trip.

we received a warm and friendly welcome from greg and molly and communication was easy and trouble free throughout.
their well presented basement apartment was private, cozy and quiet;  the location was excellent - very close to the subway, bus stops and other conveniences. it is even close enough to explore a lot of the city by foot if you enjoy walking.
we had a great first airbnb experience and are happy to recommend this apartment - everything exactly as described.

175581,8311352,2013-10-25,6931188,Ellen,"i loved the capitol hill apartment!  everything was exactly as descibed by the owners and other guests.  the proximity to the metro and the near by neighborhood store make this my first choice for any future trips to dc.  the amenities provided make the apartment a little home away from home.  you would be hard pressed to find hosts more gracious and helpful than molly and greg!

the wifi worked well, we had a tv in the bedroom and books to research the area. we hope to return next spring and meet the new baby joining sweet mary alice and sally in the happy family.

181078,725683,2011-11-17,557990,Benjamin,"vadim was essentially the perfect airbnb host.  he worked with us on scheduling to arrange key transfer, was immediately responsive to email, and was courteous and polite.  
first, the location of this apartment is top notch.  there is a wonderful falafel shop just down the street, bars, easy cab access, and interesting people around.
the apartment itself is, if you can believe it, even better than what was shown in the photos.  spacious, well equipped, spotlessly clean, and comfortable.  vadim took care to label any subtleties about the place, so at no point were we surprised.
i wholeheartedly recommend vadim as a host."

181078,2641465,2012-10-17,2424282,Aron,"vadim's place was excellent. it's right off a main drag in adams morgan, so you're near a ton of stuff, and the place itself is huge, extremely clean, and really comfortable. it's got a great feel to it with lots of natural light, clean wood floors, and a nice amount of personal decoration. it feels like a home but you don't feel like you're in someone else's space.

vadim is also a great host: communication was really simple and friendly and he replied to every message immediately.

the next time i go to dc i'm going to search my airbnb history and look up his place again."
181078,2969661,2012-11-26,4049391,Marc,"vadim  was a great host.  the arrangements were easy and flexible.  the apartment was just what we hoped for - comfortable, spacious and fully equiped.  his modern kitchen allowed us to prepare a complete thanksgiving meal, and the apartment was perfect for a small gathering of friends.  the adams-morgan neighborhood is definitely hopping at night, so it is best if you enjoy city life.  we would rent it again if we have the occasion."
181078,3405744,2013-01-24,4080233,Daisy,"our stay at vadim's place was incredible. the place was even nicer than the pictures suggest which is a rarity. he was also responsive, courteous and left excellent notes once we got to the place to show us how to use the tv, lights etc. the location of his place is amazing, walking distance to shops, restaurants, bars and metro. if you're lucky enough to stay at vadim's place you will not regret it.

181078,3721624,2013-03-08,4923047,Lourdes,beautiful apartment and impeccable host. highly recommend.  i was in town with family for work and the location couldn't have been better. 
181078,4164005,2013-04-15,1777813,Tashunka,the booking process was easy and the apartment far surpassed expectations. we were two couples traveling from nyc to dc for the weekend and the apartment was definitely spacious enough not to be crowded with 4 people. the bedrooms were lovely and big and the beds so comfortable.  the apartment was extremely clean and secure. the apartment is just off a bustling street with cafes and bars which was super easy for us to stroll down the street for some fun. despite the proximity to a busy street the apartment is generally very quiet. we had such a wonderful time in vadim’s apartment and the interaction with vadim was quick and easy. i can’t recommend this apartment and its host enough.
181078,4568012,2013-05-13,5520454,Beatrice,"vadim was a great host. booking process was efficient and simple as it was the first time i was using airbnb. arrival and key collection was easy. the condo was lovely and well situated around the corner to 18th st nw, lots of restaurants and bars around, very spacious for 4 people and the jacuzzi bath, not mentioned, definitely a plus which i really enjoyed! 
we had a good time at vadim’s apartment; only one set of keys were tiny issue to split company with our friends. we felt like at home but only better! i also got the chance to meet vadim’s as we were 1 hour late checking out and it was great, vadim was very friendly and not at all annoyed, thank you for your patience.
we would highly recommend and definitely stayed there again if we visit again!

181078,5412080,2013-06-29,5241976,Cori,"vadim's place was great and exactly as pictured.  there were lots of windows, comfortable beds/furniture, and a fully furnished kitchen.  we stayed for 3 weeks, and it was spacious enough for all 4 of us (adults), and a dog.  the location was a perfect central location in adams morgan, and allowed us to bike everywhere we wanted.  there was only 1 key, which was less than ideal given our longer stay, but we made it work.  it would get loud on the weekend nights but we expected this given the neighborhood, and other reviews.  there are grocery stores nearby (3 blocks), as well as amsterdam falafel and duccini's jumbo slice for late night eats (yum!).  we never felt unsafe in this area, although we were careful as well.  

our main complaint would be the parking situation, which we should have looked into prior to our arrival.  however, vadim took the time to help us by driving back into dc and obtaining a visitor parking permit for us two days after our arrival (thank you so much!).  

beyond a lovely apartment, vadim was a pleasure to deal with!  he was quick to respond, within minutes every time, to any of our questions/requests/needs from initial booking all the way through the end of our stay.  we loved our stay in dc, and i would highly recommend vadim and his place!"
181078,7237065,2013-09-13,6170935,Dan,"we had a great time in vadim's condo. we loved the neighborhood (convenient to restaurants, shopping, but not so much the metro...more walking than we needed at the end of each day, but it still worked great). vadim was a great host. as other reviewers have noted, it was easy checking in and out, and if anything comes up during the stay, vadim is very responsive and makes sure you have what you need. overall a great visit."
181078,8325236,2013-10-26,1282325,Shabbir,"i stayed in this newly renovated 2 br in the heart of adams morgan for a week while working in dc.  while it has some quirks, it's both a great value and an impressive location with an extremely attentive host.

the pros: the location can't be beat.  you've got some of the best restaurants in dc at both the high and the low end.  you're close to lots of transportation, an affordable parking garage ($19/day) that's cheaper than a hotel valet, and a bikeshare station.   the host, vadim, was available by email, phone, and text before and during our stay and we found just about everything we needed within the apartment.  

the wifi was great, as was the tv and the spaciousness of it.   3 of us camped out and worked for most of the week in between meetings and enjoyed our time in this apartment immensely.

the cons:  there is only one key for the building's front door.  since this is a 2 br, you might be traveling with another party that isn't always with you.  in that case you need to coordinate coming/going so one of you can let the other one in.  the nice bedroom is also on a street with a lot of ""walk-by"" noise.  the blinds don't block out that much light.  if you're a light sleeper, you would want to bring earplugs and an eyemask, or just sleep in the second bedroom which is better for heavy sleepers.

bottom line: with the caveats, the price, location, and spaciousness makes this too good of a deal to pass up."
181078,8506934,2013-11-03,9169408,Princess,"this is a very spacious apartment in the heart of adams morgan.  we stayed for a week with our two sons and mil and found it a great location with crucial amenities (laundry/full furnished kitchen/comfortable beds/full bath) - the boys found the bathtub which is more of a jacuzzi - delightful!  vadim is very accommodating.  only down side for us it was fairly noisy at night (vadim did let us know it can be) after bars close, etc.  also we are from a small town so we're more sensitive to noise of the city.

184144,1067938,2012-04-01,541090,Jasmine,"loved staying at pierre's beautiful apartment in dupont this past march. ideal location, two block walk to dupont metro stop, and close to great restaurants and cute boutique stores. i even enrolled in a two week yoga membership while i was there - there are two great studios less than a 5 minute walk away. my friends living in dc couldn't believe what a great location i had. the neighborhood is also very beautiful and safe - i always felt comfortable walking around at night. apartment had a comfortable bed and couches, and lots of natural light - pictures posted on airbnb are very accurate and exactly what the apartment looked like. being from california, i was worried about the cold, but the heaters warmed up the room in seconds. laundry was downstairs, which was convenient as well. i couldn't think of anything negative to say about my stay the entire time i was there.

pierre was also very friendly, and was always checking in periodically via email to make sure i was doing ok, and to see if i had any questions or concerns. nice to know that he was always available in case i needed anything.

in summary, beautiful, comfortable apartment; close to everything you possibly need; and very responsive and friendly host."
184144,1100793,2012-04-09,275837,Julie & Dag,"pierre's appartment is exactly like the pictures: cosy, colourful and stylish.  we really enjoyed it. it is a perfect place to relax after a busy day in dc. it has a decent bed and a nice hot shower. the location is really convenient: on a quiet beautiful residential block just one block away from  the action (breakfast places, restaurants, shops, ... ) and 2 minutes from dupont circle metro. i would definitely recommend this place and certainly return if i have the chance. pierre is a lovely host. he is always quick to reply, always "" stand-by"" during our stay, he is very caring and eager to help you out with practical information. the price was really quite reasonable considering what we got for it.  
bottom line: book this place before it's too late !"
195344,482304,2011-08-28,893014,Milos,"nat was an amazing host! i literary have no words to express my gratitude and to say how impressed i am.
first of all, she went out of her way to organize our stay on extremely short notice. she spent a lot of attention on small details, trying to make us as comfortable as possible. the fact that she changed her entire schedule in order to be able to meet us at the apartment, combined with her kindness and extraordinary hospitality really touched us. 
the apartment itself is amazing - i remember being skeptical after i saw the pictures, because i couldn't believe it can be real - but it is! :) it's very spacious and comfortable, has great amenities, and is in one of the best locations in dc!
therefore, i highly recommend both nat as a host, and her apartment as a lovely place to stay. "
195344,496320,2011-09-02,581931,Reggie,"nat was a great host. as a regular business traveler it is important that lodging is clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. nat's downtown apartment both met and exceeded these expectations. luxury for this location is an understatement! the beauty of this apartment matches exactly what you see in the pictures. i would highly recommend this location if you are looking for a spacious 1br apartment in the heart of chocolate city. "
195344,539564,2011-09-17,656573,Constantinos,"i absolutely loved my stay at nat's downtown apartment! for a party of three, the apartment was very comfortable, with it's spacious living room and study. the location could not be better - just a couple of blocks away from a major metro stop, easy to connect to the whole city, but it's also a short walk to much of what dc has to offer - a few blocks from the national portrait gallery, chinatown, and a 15 minute walk to the national mall where the capitol and all the museums are.

the photos do indeed do the apartment justice: it's very charming, well decorated and spacious, and spotless. you don't have to tiptoe around the personal property of the host, with the overbearing personal touches you may see in other apartments - you feel like you can settle in immediately, as you would in a hotel suite - a huge plus in my book.

nat was very accommodating in every way, most importantly, our unforgiving arrival / departure schedule. we arrived a bit before midnight and picked up the keys from the lobby (it's a doorman attended building). for our departure, dropping off the keys was just as easy when we had to leave early am to catch a flight.

all in all, we had a fantastic time, and i definitely hope to stay at nat's whenever i get a chance to return to dc."
195344,569123,2011-09-26,672592,Michelle,nat was great. the apartment exceeded our expectations! it was the perfect location and only a short walk to everything we wanted to do. the roof top view was fabulous. we hope to stay again next time we are in dc.
195344,577835,2011-09-28,985755,Susan,"terrific location, very attractive and well set up apartment.  we only stayed two nights and really wanted to stay longer because it was so nice - excellent value.  there is a serious coffee shop just around the corner  - (website hidden by airbnb) and chinatown restaurants too. only a short walk to two metro stations made for ease of moving around washington dc.  would certainly recommend this accommodation.  "
195344,587218,2011-10-01,581931,Reggie,"nat, was a great host and the location was true to its description. i hope to stay again the next time i'm in the dc area. "
195344,598509,2011-10-04,174385,Kevin,".nat's apartment in the chinatown / penn quarter section of dc epitomizes the airbnb experience - a centrally located flat where you feel like a ""local"", if only for a few days.  this is a large, well-appointed space with a nod towards modern yet functional design (yes, the pictures are accurate representations). and no detail has been left out - drinks in the fridge, snacks on the counter, restaurant menus, fluffy towels, wireless internet, blankets for curling up on the sofa, etc.  in short, the kind of place that makes you wonder why anyone would ever stay in a hotel."
195344,608272,2011-10-08,1019393,Samantha,"fantastic location and the place is huge - lots of room to sleep people on beds and multiple comfy couches. it was clean, comfortable and nat had left us a basket of snacks and water/soft drinks which we appreciated after a long train ride. 

we enjoyed being able to walk to all of the dc sights - very close to the mall, smithsonian's, congress, etc. the desk staff were very pleasant and welcoming - they let us keep our bags with them after we'd checked out, which gave us some extra time for touristy activities.

i would highly recommend this place and would return for my next stay in dc."
195344,616308,2011-10-10,640199,Nikki,the apartment was nicely decorated and the location was great!  i would definitely stay here again.  
195344,628506,2011-10-14,376470,Genevieve & Kevin,"we weren't able to meet nat as she was out of town but her assistant, albert, was lovely. he was very helpful and gracious. nat's apartment is very spacious and is in a central and convenient neighbourhood. we were lucky to have amazing fall weather, and took advantage of her fantastic roof. we were in dc on business, and it was so nice to be able to come back to a proper home at the end of the day. thanks, nat!"
195344,637009,2011-10-17,1168515,Valerie,"nat, your place was absolutely wonderful....clean, fresh smelling and great location. we loved the view from the rooftop, even grilled some steaks up there...we would love to come back!"
195344,695133,2011-11-06,1106309,Karen,"the property was just as listed. great location. easy walk to the metro, grocery store and many restaurants.  plenty of towels and blankets. the kitchen also had everything we needed. the exercise room was convienent and well equipt. the rooftop was beautiful. in warmer weather, it would be a great place to eat or sit and relax. nat was very welcoming and answered any texts/calls promptly. she is committed to helping her guests have a great stay!"
195344,723712,2011-11-16,414749,Kevin,our stay at nat's place was perfect. the apartment is just spectacular and we were extremely comfortable staying there. we didnt want to leave! i'm jealous of anyone who has the luck to secure a nights stay here. thank you very much nat :d
195344,762544,2011-12-04,581931,Reggie,another great experience. 
195344,787662,2011-12-16,748378,Jen,"absolutely loved staying at nat's place.  beautiful, modern apartment with plush finishes.  fantastic location.  very safe neighborhood.  nat' was delightful and very helpful with local knowledge.  we were very sad to leave."
195344,805987,2011-12-26,548972,Sabiha,"beautiful apartment - as in the pictures. tastefully furnished. convenient location for public transport, close to museums andwashington attractions. cvs pharmacy downstairs and safeway supermarket walking distance. nat was friendly  and sincere and attended to our requests. sometimes she may be hard to get hold of - probably because of her work, but she always gets back to you. overall thoroughly enjoyed our stay. highly recommended."
195344,814638,2011-12-30,1425411,Aimee,great location!  nat is a wonderful host and the place is very special.  we were excited to have such a warm space to come home to during the busy holiday season.  we would stay again anytime and hope to do so next time we are in dc.  thank you!
195344,851591,2012-01-09,511667,Marie,"nat was an exceptional host! extremely warm, accommodating, and hospitable. the property was immaculate and accurately described as luxury. convenient location and i couldn't ask for anything more. a dc airbnb staple for sure :-) thanks nat!"
195344,869914,2012-01-18,1313644,Howard,"we stayed in nat's apartment for a week in january 2012. it's exactly as presented on the website, a very classy & stylish apartment on massachusetts ave, walking distance from union station, all the great sights on the mall and lots of restaurants nearby. you couldn't ask for a better location. a very safe area with 24 hr. concierge. it's perfect for a couple but spacious enough for a family. we have twin 12 year old sons who slept in the large lounge area easily.

however, the boys complained about the  fold-out bed being very uncomfortable and perhaps nat should invest in a better one. nat herself is very friendly and welcoming. my only other criticism is she didn't reply to my emails and had me concerned as late as a week before leaving australia abt. the contact details for arrival and the apt. number etc. airbnb helped sort this out and then nat was good in texting me and being there when we arrived. apart from these 2 points i recommend nat and her apartment to anyone visiting washington dc.  - howard charles, sydney australia."
195344,885718,2012-01-27,1581573,Phil,"can't fault this enourmous appartment.  everything gleamed 'newness'.  vast south facing windows provided ample light (pity there was little sun in jan).  enough dishes even though we missed the clean set in the dish washer.
3-4 blocks from both gallery/china town and also from judiciary place on the red line.  0.7 miles/15 min walk to the galleries on the mall.

after calling on arrival at regan airport we were met by  the friendly and helpful nat and family .  no real issues.  (a few lights had blown so they came immediately to change them after phoning a report.)"
195344,914858,2012-02-12,672592,Michelle,"we came to dc for a training event and chose to stay at nat's place instead of the conference hotel and i recomend this idea to anyone who finds themselves in a simular situation. 
this has become a favorite place of mine to stay in dc. i love it! the views are amazing and it is humblng to see the us capitol from the roof top of the building.
"
195344,933654,2012-02-20,1603958,Charlie,"nat made everything really simple, and the apartment was gorgeous!"
195344,979901,2012-03-07,928212,Neil,"the apartment is spacious, bright, lots of sun, comfortable, convenient to the convention center which we went to daily, cvs downstairs has a small market which made getting items easy… safeway a few blocks away.   natalie is lovely, extremely warm and engaging, made us immediately feel at home, gave us some tips about the area re: restaurants and transportation.  she had some cheese, crackers and grapes waiting for us upon arrival which was very thoughtful.

the garbage disposal would not work.  we called natalie, she scheduled the plumber but she did not come over to meet him, we had to be there which was not convenient – it took some time as he replaced the disposal.   the refrigerator was not cleaned out by the cleaning lady, there was old, stale fruit which we had to dispose of;  there was no kleenex and next to no toilet paper, both of which we purchased; no place in the stall shower to place a bar of soap other than on the floor;  the tv in the bedroom needed a cable box and it would have been nice to have a channel listing for d.c.   if anyone brings their own computer, which needs wifi, suggest you have natalie check it out before she leaves the apartment in case it needs to be reset. "
195344,1005086,2012-03-17,1288285,Abdelmajid,"i really had a great stay at nat's condo. the condo is well located inside dc which made it easier for me to wander around. this definitely will be my favorite stay at dc. thank you nat for your hospitality. sincerely from majid, san antonio, tx."
195344,1039077,2012-03-25,1423728,Ted,"nat is a great hostess.  i believe she would have done anything in her power to make our stay a better experience.  she truly cared about our family and when out of her way to help us.  my wife and i were in washington dc for a week with our 2 kids for spring break.  the location of the unit is great, a short walk to the metro in the chinatown area.  we were close enough to the national mall to even walk home a couple of days.  after a long day of being tourist, we were able to head back toward the condo and find many good and affordable restaurants in the immediate area.  the unit itself is very large and gave my family of 4 plenty of room.  we did use the kitchen and the great grill and dining area on the roof.  the kids wished the pool was open, but it was too early in the season.  there is a safeway only 3 block away for grocery shopping.  having a washer/dryer in the unit was very convenient as well.  the building itself was safe and secure.  we felt safe not only in the building, but also walking the streets day or night.     i would highly recommend this condo for anyone traveling to washington whether it be for business or pleasure.  when we travel back to dc, i know where we will be staying.  thanks again, nat.     "
195344,1058054,2012-03-29,281872,Anna,clean place and friendly owner.  in a great location!! 
195344,1095801,2012-04-08,1324265,Janet,"nat's place was the perfect getaway for myself, my son, and my niece for spring break week. lots of space in a prime location, walking distance to many dc attractions and metro to everything else. within walking distance we visited the smithsonians, went to 'the hunger games' on the big screen, and ate authentic chinese in chinatown. saved lots of money by using the kitchen to cook and eat in for many meals, with a very reasonably priced safeway store nearby. by the end of the week we felt like it was our neighborhood and our 'place' and we didn't want to leave."
195344,1157559,2012-04-21,1187614,Joan,the apartment was the perfect spot for our recent family trip to d.c.  we walked everywhere....including the convenient three blocks to an awesome grocery store.  the apartment was roomy with 4 of us and we loved being able to return home to eat in....we were just too exhausted to have to go to out.  be sure to check out the spectacular night view from the rook deck!  thanks nat!
195344,1187172,2012-04-27,1541011,Merry,"myself and 2 friends spent 5 nights in this apt.  plenty of space , both living and closet.  close to transportation, markets and as many restaurants as anyone could possibly want.
nat goes out of her way to insure your stay is pleasant.  couple of minor issues, that were resolved immediately.  "
195344,1269572,2012-05-13,1340812,Lisa,fantastic apartment in the heart of dc. great location. we didn't even use our car for a week and we took up the option to park it in the building so very handy. walked to absolutely everything including the safeway supermarket which is only around 5 mins walk. all the museums and monuments are around 10 mins walk too. the fold out bed was also really good as far as fold out beds go.... and the main bed... wow so comfy!!!!
195344,1300121,2012-05-18,1299321,Phill,nat's apartment is fantastic.  i'm an airbnb host.  i've stayed at a number of airbnb hosts.  nat's place is probably the best place i've stayed at so far.  nat is a great host. she is friendly and energetic.  the apartment is spotless.  it is in a great location.  the roof top deck has a 360 view of the entire dc area.  i visit dc often and plan to stay with nat as often as possible
195344,1334157,2012-05-23,1865202,Kayla,the apartment was awesome!! thanks for helping us hillbillies out in the big city. they went beyond what was required to insure us a good time.
195344,1377697,2012-05-29,2407950,Sarah,"wonderful apartment, amenities and location for exploring dc.  3 adults and 1 child stayed here very comfortably.  great kitchen and apartment layout offers a variety of lounging and sleeping arrangements.

nat is wonderful as well and we plan to request the apartment if we visit dc again.  she answered all our questions and ensured we were set up properly.  seamless experience. 

"
195344,1430507,2012-06-07,1586819,Paula,"a wonderful apartment, we walked to all the sights, and relaxed by rooftop pool. the place could not be better - and the fluffiest, softest towels too.
the only thing that spoiled our stay a little was poor communication before we arrived. i did not hear from nat until 12 hours before we left the uk, so had a very anxious time the day before wondering if we were going to be homeless when we arrived. but hey, it all worked out in the end, and i recommend the place 100%."
195344,1456019,2012-06-11,500550,Aaron,"this apartment is a gem in a great area of town. it's just outside of china town and only 3 blocks from the nearest metro station. the apartment is in a very nice and recently built building. it's very cosy, clean and provides all amenities that one could want. the roof of the building provides a gorgeous panorama of the city that can't be missed. around the entire rooftop are chairs and tables to enjoy the view along with a pool and more private alcoves for quiet conversation. 
i dare anyone to find a better all around place to stay for the price that's offered! the next time i am back in dc, i will definitely try to stay here again and will recommend this location to my colleagues."
195344,1564294,2012-06-26,1420683,Alistair,"this apartment is absolutely superb. everything you could want. it's spacious, has lovely furniture, a huge bathroom, great kitchen. there's a gym and pool you can use. just brilliant. nat was great and really helpful."
195344,1673620,2012-07-10,463817,Christina,"this is the very first time that i have rented a place rather than staying at hotels.  we rented the place for 9 nights and 10 days.

i had plenty of communications between nat and i prior to arriving.  i let her know that i was to arrive late and since she was out of town, she had her associate meet with me at the place.  i texted him twice, once from the airport and once when i was in taxi to let him know i was on my way.  the associate was not ready for me and we were waiting for him for about 10 minutes under an awning while it was raining outside.  he came out of the building and was unapologetic and was ""surprised"" that i was earlier than expected.  

once we got into the apartment, he showed us around the place and we went through the place quickly and then he offered to show us the roof top swimming pool.  we went with him to see the pool, but there was a swarm of people there having a party so we decided not to go look at it that night.  he explained that the residents have a private party during the weekends.   the associate told us to text him or nat any time if we have any questions.    well it turns out we did, but he wasn't responsive to our inquiries...

after he left,  we started to explore the place a little further, and found out that several things were out of order.  the door knob to the pantry door was barely hanging by one screw, the place wasn't cleaned properly so some spots were sticky, one of the bathroom ceiling lights were not working so the entire time we were there we did our laundry in the dark, and the blinds for the patio door were not in working condition.  the cleaner also had overlooked the coffee pot which previous renters must have used.  since i'm not a coffee drinker, it took me 7 days into our stay to find out that there was used coffee filter with coffee in it that was growing a heap of disgusting molds!  also, the shower stall wasn't cleaned properly and there were other people's hair collection in the corner of the shower floor.  yuk!

in regards to the minor non-working items and a simple question of ""where to dump the trash"", i had texted both nat and the associate on that first night.  i didn't get a response from either of them for the first two days.  on the second day, i did get a call from the associate, but he said that he never received any of my vms or texts, citing something about the weather conditions and the phone company problems... well, by this time we'd already figured out where to dump the trash, so i didn't bother calling him back.  and i haven't heard from him until i texted him that i was checking out on the last day.  i also found out later on that nat was out of the country during our stay.

the condo itself is nice and relatively new, except for the fact certain things i mentioned above are falling apart due to usage by some abusive renters.  the place does look like it does in the picture, just not as clean.  i highly suggest that nat replace her cleaning lady. the location is close to some of the museums, many restaurants, and grocery stores.  it is located on a major street in the front and is very busy road so it's easy to catch a cab, etc.  however, after a couple of days of walking to certain sights via the building's backroad, my husband started taking detours around to the front of the building...i asked him why were we taking that route when obviously the backroad was shorter?  he convinced me that the front road was shorter...which i didn't believe but didn't think much of it and just followed him.  well, knowing how paranoid i get with certain things, he purposely avoided the backroads and finally told me on our last day of stay that the buildings in the back of the condo are projects!  he told me that one day when he was walking towards our condo via the backroad with our kids, he saw whole bunch of scary characters doing suspicious dealings... what's more, the very first night we got there, we went down to cvs store to buy some water, etc. and there was a commotion outside between couple of characters.  they were fighting with vulgar language and the cashier started to get nervous and said ""gee, i hope they don't start shooting now!""  can you imagine my reaction to her comment??  after that, we didn't bother going out after dark.

a few days before our last day of stay, nat emailed me asking if everything was ok.  i emailed her regarding all the minor problems that we've encountered and she was very apologetic.  however, i felt that she was very responsive prior to our contract was final and after my complaints.  in between the time frame just before our stay and during our stay, i felt that she wasn't responsive at all.  according to nat and the assoc. she was out of the country.  

ever since i complained about the problems i was having during our stay, nat has been asking me what is a fair price i have in mind for her to refund me for my inconveniences.  well, i have no idea what is a fair price, since i haven't rented a place before, so i told her to just decide and refund me if she likes.  then she kept asking again via email if i'd thought about a ""fair amount.""  after a discussion with my husband, he suggested that 10% refund would be fair since we paid little over $2000 for our stay.  usually when hotels put their clients through some kind of inconveniences they offer a free night on them.  so i thought 10% which is equivalent to one free night stay would be fair.  well, i haven't heard from her since then.  i don't really care if i get the credit or not, but i feel as if the hostess is ""all talk.""  i've never met her personally, and it's sad that this is the impression i get.   

1 star is for somewhat convenient location, despite the iffy neighborhood in the back.  1 star is for the reasonable price per sq.ft. of space.  overall this condo is an ok place to stay for the money.  it was a little over $200/night for our stay, which's cheap considering the space you get! "
195344,1755233,2012-07-20,2163496,Sparky,the one-bedroom condo is in a great location for downtown washington dc.  unit is located on 7th floor but still gets quite a bit of street noise which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5..  the queen bed is comfortable but the location of the sofa bed is in the middle of the living area so not really a private sleeping area.  we used the couch in the office area as the second sleeping space and skipped the sofa bed.  the building has a nice gym and great rooftop hangout with a lap pool.  i would definitely come back to stay!
195344,1889797,2012-08-05,1489079,Steve,"we spent 3 nights at nat's apartment in early august 2012. the apartment was really well located and equally well presented - it really is a great place to stay and feels much more like a home than a short term let. 

nat was helpfull from well before us even arriving in washington  - she certainly provides 'added value' over other letting representatives.

drinks on the rooftop garden (as well as use of the pool) were very welcome at the end of each long and active day.

195344,2165201,2012-09-01,464894,Jasmine,"nat's apartment is amazing! probably one of the best we have stayed in using airbnb. it was incredibly clean and close to everywhere we needed in dc. we enjoyed the rooftop pool too, its a shame we weren't able to stay longer than 2 nights. we will definitely be using nat's apartment every time we are in dc!"

195344,2336983,2012-09-18,79977,Thorsten,"stylish and lots of clean designed space, a balcony for smoking, good location with a good lunch and evening restaurant downstairs, ""6th street station"" with good outside seating. ask for desserts from their dessert chef deborah.

very secure building with 24 hour manned door, close to train station and the happening streets. a walk from the white house, though it was surprisingly small. we did see obama drive away in the car, though and was yelled at by the secret service, ""what part of sidewalk don't you understand?""

overall a great experience.

195344,2502297,2012-10-04,2599535,Judith,"we spent one week in nat's condo and we couldn't have had a more comfortable place to rest at the end of a long day of sight seeing.  there was just the two of us so the amount of space was more than adequate - plenty of room for additional people if needed.  the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was large with a walk in closet, two showers, bathtub, double sinks plus washer/dryer combo.  we did not do any cooking but the kitchen was fully loaded with stove, oven, micro, coffee maker, toaster, refrig, dishwasher, dishes, pots, pans, silverware, and lots more. there are several seating areas depending on what activity you are engaged in - tv, internet use, eating, reading, etc.  there's a small balcony to check out the area and get a feel for the days temperature and on the rooftop there is a huge balcony for snapping pictures of exceptional city views. the metro is within walking distance as well as chinatown, restaurants, gallery place shopping, and there is a cvs right next to the condo building. we felt safe in the condo as well as walking around the entire area.  the condo residents are friendly and the front desk person (even though we did not bother them with anything) always had a smile and a friendly hello everytime we walked by.  nat was a gracious hostess.  she met us at the condo with keys and went over directions regarding the tv, internet, etc.  she was available to us if we needed assistance with anything but we had no problems.  thanks for renting us your condo, nat, we very much enjoyed our stay.  we would have no problem recommending this condo to anyone who wants to spend time in dc.  
"
195344,2536186,2012-10-08,2201316,Lyndon,"nat's apartment is a perfect base for any stay in washington dc.  we only stayed for a short period of time, but enjoyed the stay immensely. nat was very accommodating and was approachable and helpful.

the apartment is exactly as shown in the photos - a spacious one bedroom apartment, which has been decorated with attention to detail.

the location is fantastic, with a range of restaurants and cafes within walking distance. chinatown is only a short walk away and we walked to the majority of monuments we visited. the metro is only a short walk away and union station is also only a short walk away. buses go past the front door, which we caught to georgetown.

overall if i were to visit washington again i would certainly see if nat's place is available before looking at other options."
195344,2579088,2012-10-11,1040697,Philippe,"doesn't the name washington dc speak for itself?
anyway, the city is amazing and boasts with landmark sights and historic places to visit. of course, it's also the hotspot of us politics.
being hosted in this apartment was a delight, as it is not only unusually comfortable and large, but it's location is absolutely brilliant!
once established, the contact with nat is excellent, and she is really an incredible forthcoming and welcoming host who will almost bend over backwards to arrange for the visitors' needs."
195344,2720262,2012-10-26,2691356,Maggie,"this was our first time using airbnb and overall it was a good experience, despite a few concerns. in the lead-up to our stay, there was a system error which meant that our booking didn't show up on nat's calendar. i started to get quite anxious when nat didn't respond to some of my messages, as we hadn't received any confirmation. in the end it was fine but i would have preferred nat to be in touch sooner, and more regularly, in the lead-up to our stay. when we arrived, nat met us outside the building and helped us upstairs with our bags (although one of the quirks of staying in a private apartment is that you might need to sneak in the back entrance to avoid the building managers as i think sub-letting is frowned upon). nat was very nice and told us all about the apartment and local attractions. we really liked the apartment as it was much bigger and better-equipped than a hotel room, as well as cheaper. very stylishly furnished and the bathroom is huge! however, we found the bed uncomfortable and quite impractical (kept bashing our shins on the wooden platform), and my mum, who was using the sofa bed, didn't enjoy her bed either. the building has a gym (we didn't use) and a lovely roof terrace from which you can see a lot of washington's iconic landmarks. the building is located within walking distance of most of the monuments, museums, restaurants and union station. it was extremely convenient to have a cvs/pharmacy in the building to get our groceries and supplies. we felt slightly unsafe walking through nearby chinatown at night, but other areas we went were fine. i would recommend ear plugs if you are a light sleeper as there seemed to be a lot of sirens in the area, but otherwise the apartment was not at all noisy. overall a successful stay and we thank nat for hosting us on our first trip to washington."
195344,2870117,2012-11-12,3162820,Jo,"perfect apartment, perfect location. i would stay there again."
195344,3184091,2012-12-30,900084,Pascal,"nice modern apartment conveniently located within washington, dc. we pretty much walked everywhere: museums, restaurants, etc. we appreciated the convenience of the 24/7 cvs in the same building."
195344,3725770,2013-03-08,5187026,Julia,"nat's apartment was just perfect for our trip. i just made a booking request very shortly one day before arriving and she answered very quickly and the booking went smoothly. all in all, nat was a very friendly and helpful host and did everything to ensure a comfortable and pleasant stay. the apartment was clean, spacious and included everything that we needed. furthermore, the location was just perfect, we could do nearly every attraction by foot. i would definitely recommend the apartment and nat as a host! thank you for the pleasant stay!"
195344,3755753,2013-03-11,3580309,Simon,"great location, nice place to base yourself and very comfortable "
195344,3789364,2013-03-15,4037871,Darron,"i had the pleasure to enjoy four nights at nat's apartment. the apartment was exactly as pictured, minus the tv in the bedroom (which is part of the reason i knocked one star off) and the imac in the living room. another reason i gave the overall experience 4/5 stars was nat was thirty minutes late to our scheduled meeting to check-in. fortunately, she suggested a wonderful restaurant to meet at (six engine) and i got to enjoy brunch while i waited for nat to arrive. nat was very apologetic for her tardiness and i didn't mind too much. the best thing about nat's apartment is the convenience to multiple metro stops (mount vernon and chinatown). i made use of the kitchen, which was equipped with all the basic necessities to cook a meal and it was also equipped with the utensils/dinnerware. the rooftop is open, however the pool is not open until late may i believe. the rooftop does have a viking grill that is pretty fancy. the gym was nothing spectacular, but just enough to get by with such a short stay. i highly recommend nat's apartment for any stays in the dc area and will likely be back to enjoy it in the summer. "
195344,3870527,2013-03-23,248788,Nicole,"our week-long stay at nat's apartment was absolutely fabulous. from the very beginning, she was quick to respond and easily accessible, meeting us at the apartment for check-in and to show us around, and keeping in touch during our stay as well.

the apartment itself is exactly like the pictures - large, comfy, and filled with light - and the bed in particular was one of the most comfortable i've ever slept in. centrally located within walking distance to the metro and virtually everything we wanted to see and do in dc, i couldn't recommend staying here highly enough! we'll definitely be back on future trips to dc."
195344,3926407,2013-03-28,1219926,Brad,"great apartment in an perfectly central location!  we found the property to be even more spacious than we expected.  it's very well appointed and has pretty much everything we needed for a three night stay in washington, d.c.  

would definitely stay here again, especially after seeing a friend's room at the embassy suites nearby for the same price and 1/3 of the space!

we met one of nat's associates, albert, who helped us in and then left us to things - no issues at all.

as mentioned in previous reviews, we did enter the first time via the service entrance to avoid a ""move in"" charge but found no issues with coming, going, or departing via the main entrance after that.

"
195344,3980208,2013-04-01,5228617,Emilio,"everything was according the offer. the apt was clean and very well furnished in a good location, near metro and stores, a very good experience, recommended

195344,4617364,2013-05-15,5892899,Frank,"simply the best accomodation possible in washington dc. for us everything was perfect, can reccommend a stay with this appartment to everybody."
195344,4807729,2013-05-27,5920552,Ingar,"we were met by excellent service and a stunning appartement for our stay in washington. too bad we only stayed for two nights.
the appartement was very nice and clean, and just walking distance to everything worth seeing in washington.
our best reccomendations for nat and her luxury appartement in downtown washington."
195344,4963021,2013-06-04,4622498,Amy,"i can't speak highly enough of our experience at nat's condo. it looked exactly like the pictures. the condo is well stocked with the necessities and extras needed to be comfortable. it was also very clean, and it was obvious the condo is cleaned specifically for each new guest. we walked in to freshly washed towels, clean bathrooms, kitchen, etc.  my husband and i absolutely loved the rooftop grills, patio area, and pool. it is definitely worth checking out. the location of the condo is also really great. we had considered staying out in georgetown or adam morgan, both areas we explored, which only confirmed that the condo's  location is perfect. it is close to all the major attractions, close to the metro to get to some of the trendy neighborhoods, has a cvs right below it for all the things you missed while packing, a grocery store, and lots of restaurants. we were very happy we picked this location instead of the other neighborhoods we checked out. this is a perfect hub, especially if you plan on doing many of the tourist activities. plus, a capital bike station is right outside of the condo. we waited until the second to last day to try this out, which was a huge mistake. not only were the bikes really practical for getting around, it added an unexpected and fun element to our trip (i highly suggest grabbing some bikes and taking a midnight trip to view of all the monuments -- highlight of our trip). we would absolutely stay here again. 

the only thing i would note is that the condo is a few blocks from a police station, so you do get an occasional siren going off at night. my husband didn't hear a thing while sleeping. however, i'm a much lighter sleeper, so it did wake me up occasionally. i used a white noise app on my phone, which helped a lot after the first night. a box fan or something would work as well. 

our host, nat, went way, way above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and make a smooth transition from traveling to settling into the condo. my husband and i were pleasantly surprised by her level of hospitality. not only is the condo beautiful, dealing with nat alone would be reason enough to stay here. she contacted us right away in the morning to ensure we were getting to dc without issue. after we had a chance to use and explore the condo a bit more, she checked in again to ensure everything was as expected and we had everything we needed. our trip was stress-free because she was attentive and a great host. i felt 100% comfortable contacting her if something was wrong (which we never needed to do) because she was so friendly and sincere. nat clearly takes pride in presenting a beautiful, clean condo and making sure her guests have a great stay. highly suggest staying here!"
195344,5003334,2013-06-06,6494688,Stephen,everything about the apartment was incredible and just like the description had stated. nat was so helpful and hospitable. nat was great! my wife and i couldn't of been more pleased with everything being exactly like she had said it would be. the apartment was perfect to come back to in the evenings. 
195344,5026500,2013-06-08,5744466,Thomas,"absolutely seamless. everything as promised, clean and super professional. great location. very spacious for 4 people, could easily fit more. can definitely recommend staying here. "
195344,5097673,2013-06-12,5324533,Samantha,"nat's apartment is a gem, so definitely consider staying here if it is available during your visit to dc. it was our first time in dc and we definitely lucked out by selecting nat's apartment. 

we never did meet nat, but she gave clear instructions to meet a friend of hers (albert) at chinatown coffee just one block away. point to note is that the apartment is 3 long blocks away from union station, so we would recommend taking a cab from there if you are arriving with luggage (will cost only usd10). we did walk from the apartment to union  station for dinner once and it was a leisurely 15 min stroll without luggage.

we entered through the service entrance for the 1st time, and were pleasantly surprised to see a beautifully designed and spacious apartment. albert was very patient in showing us around the apartment and explaining how to use the washing machine/dryer and also connecting to the wifi. 

the apartment is spotlessly clean when you reach and this encouraged us to keep it just as tidy when we left. we spent many late nights on the extremely comfortable sofa watching tv. the kitchen itself is very well equipped with lots of equipment if you are inclined to cook (which we never did). 

the tatami bed itself is comfortable enough, although we would mention that even from the 7th floor, you can still hear occasional sirens and street noise. this did not really bother us, although if you are a very light sleeper, it might. 

there are double sinks (bliss!) in the restroom and a choice of a shower or bath-tub area. as mentioned, the washer/dryer is in the restroom itself and is really simple and easy to use. 

as for the location itself, we would deem it as very convenient for tourists in the penn quarter. you are one block away from chinatown/verizon centre. we never used the subway once in dc, strolling all the way to the national mall from our apartment (this takes about 20 minutes and you can always pickup breakfast around chinatown). 

we really enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend to all travelers coming to dc. happy travels! "
195344,5174995,2013-06-17,5272749,Gordon,"the place was outstanding for me and my family.  everything went great.  plenty of room for everyone.  beautiful deck too.  even the building rooftop is beautiful.  nat is a great host.

195344,5557902,2013-07-06,909049,Clara,"great apartment for a short or long stay in dc.  my husband and i had a wonderful time and plan on returning next time we are in dc!

195344,5840717,2013-07-19,4587066,Asha,"stayed at nat's place for a week for a convention. five gold stars!  absolutely enjoyed my stay.  the location was perfect (convenient to rail and bus), and the apartment was exactly like the pictures.  nat was very responsive and took care of our every need.  i'll be sure to stay here again on any other trips to dc."
195344,6107322,2013-07-30,1839463,George,amazing place! absolutely amazing. i highly suggest staying here if you're visiting dc. the rooftop pool is fantastic in the summer and overlooks the capital. there are great restaurants right nearby. thanks nat! 
195344,6306447,2013-08-07,7324400,Tristan,"from manhattan, i traveled with 2 young daughters and my wife, and had a friend for a few days. natalie met us upon arrival and made us feel welcome and had everything ready for us: towels, sheets, beds, wi-fi. the apartment was just as it was advertised: clean, modern, quiet, and close to grocery store (10-min walk to safeway) and restaurants. it's such a luxury to have a nice kitchen with a center island and washer/dryer in the bathroom. the building's water pressure is bit a weak but that's not the apartment's issue. we met the neighbors with kids and they were delightful. the rooftop pool was my kids' favorite. it wasn't crowded and very safe because it's only 4 ft. deep. public transportation is 2-blocks away (metro blue line). the national mall is about a 15-minute walk with a stroller. union station (for amtrak etc.) is a 10-min walk. the apartment faces a busy street but it's in a high enough floor so you can barely hear the traffic. although the occasional siren sounds loud, but that's city life. all day and all night, if you walk a few blocks from the apartment, you'll see a lot of homeless and bystanders milling around. it's not as bad as san francisco civic center area but it's quite noticeable. we never felt at risk or threatened but that depends on your tolerance. if you're driving, there are some parking options but you have to ask natalie. gladly, we had a car during our stay because i think it would be very difficult to move around d.c. with young kids while taking public transportation or walking. our top d.c. spots for kids: yards park, jefferson library, the mall, georgetown waterfront park, and national gallery. overall, the apartment is a gem."
195344,6555313,2013-08-17,6429042,Scott,"our stay in washington d.c. was amazing thanks to nat and her place. i was there for a conference and brought the family - such an awesome choice. the photos of the clean-line, modern interior design are 100% accurate. we happen to love that style. i met nat (on time), she showed me the in's and out's during a brief tour and we were set. 

tons of clean linens, every cabinet had more clean linens! the washer and dryer were a real plus and cvs is right downstairs. the place was immaculate and we could not have asked for more. nice kitchen to cook in, comcast cable, wifi, (website hidden by airbnb) was just like being at home. the building is quiet and everyone seems to be very friendly. the views from the rooftop pool were beautiful and we found that to be a nice place to read for a few, soak in a little sun or just cool off in the water. 

tons of food choices nearby as well as union station. some days we took a taxi to the mall (only ran around $5-7). i walked the four blocks to the convention center and stopped by safeway on the way home - incredibly convenient.

nat is a top-notch host. i will be returning to washington for work semi-regularly and i look forward to staying there again many times in the future."
195344,6705914,2013-08-22,6345740,Patrick,"nat leases a large clear and well-equipped accommodation close to the capitol and all museums.

rental that i recommend to anyone who wants to know washington."
195344,6871032,2013-08-28,810740,Monica,the apartment was great! within walking distance to judiciary square and to chinatown.
195344,7274931,2013-09-14,7514359,Geoffrey,"we had a very pleasant say at nat's place. the apartment is very well located, close by foot to all the major sights, a large super market is 3 blocks away,  with a convenience store  in the building. the apartment is spacious, well supplied with comfortable furniture and everything you would need for your stay and was clean on our arrival despite the previous tenant leaving late.  

nat was very helpful and even bought a couple of requirements which were running low in the apartment for us .

195344,7871693,2013-10-07,1838122,Jeff & Donna,"we enjoyed our stay in dc at nat's apartment. the apartment is spacious, comfortably furnished and has a well-equipped kitchen. it's conveniently located to the gallery place, judiciary square and mt. vernon square metro stations and is within walking distance of the national mall and many other sights. there's a safeway a few blocks away and the nearby restaurants are good - we enjoyed particularly good dinners at tel'veh wine bar across the street and 6th engine right downstairs as well as a very nice brunch at busboys and poets a few blocks away.

a couple of things to be aware of - there are a few blocks immediately west and south of the apartment that can be sketchy after dark. massachusetts street itself is fine and the building is well secured, so we'd just recommend using good judgment if walking back to the building after dark or consider getting a taxi. also, we had difficulty getting in touch with nat to arrange our check in and wound up staying in a hotel (kindly covered by airbnb) for our first night in dc. nat was very friendly and accommodating when we did get in touch with her via airbnb customer service and we successfully checked in the next morning, so it seems like this was perhaps just an oversight. in any case, we'd just advise future travelers to make sure to get positive confirmation of check in arrangements before starting their trip. "
195344,8803882,2013-11-18,9143578,Bailey,"nat. was. awesome. 

1. we got in late (2am) from our plane. she accommodated us. no problem.
2. the apt is close to anything and everything in dc. not to mention is right next door to a cvs for any grocery needs & whatnot.
3. the apt is beautiful and well kept. 
4. if you have a car there are garages all over and even some free street parking if you keep your eye out.
5. right next to the on ramp so when you are leaving for the air port... it will take no longer than 10min.

loved the experience and will definitely be booking again with nat!"

the next morning however, i got some very bad news (a close friend had died in an accident so i wanted to return to belgium as fast as possible) and robin helped me out a lot!

she allowed me to use her mobile and laptop to help me out, en drove me to the bus station (i took an airplane in ny) herselve! she really took al the time i needed, although she had some other plans!

198685,878575,2012-01-23,1573649,Andrew,"we were in town being tourists and spent the night here, on the grounds that it was cheap and easy to get to. a ten minute bus trip from the national mall got us a block from the house. robin and her household made us feel welcome and gave us loads of good suggestions on where to eat and what to see. we were tired enough, we ended up spending the evening hanging out at the house, and it was friendly and fun.

the neighborhood is safe. i parked my car and barely returned to it the 2-3 days i was there. the bus stop is just across from the house and a few short minutes walk up the street.  

 i had a great time, so much so i almost wanted to just visit with them and hang out.  robin gave awesome directions to help me navigate the city via bus/train.  a bike is available if you are interested in seeing the area that way but i didn't this time. 

they have a dog, mitzy. very lovable.

198685,1045708,2012-03-26,1891905,Bavo,i had a nice stay. robin was helpful and there were lots of maps and folders of museums and things to do. the room was big enough and i slept really good (much better than in the hotel i'm staying now...). i could easily park my car close by for a few days. the house is close to a bus stop that will bring you close to the national mall.
198685,1059275,2012-03-29,1932152,Kinji,very nice
198685,1071452,2012-04-02,1693870,Ayodamola,"wow... great room and great host. had all the comforts of home... plus feel in love w/ the adorable dog :) i highly recommend robins' place, close to transportation, clean, and private. wish i could have stayed longer... wil make sure to come back for a visit."
198685,1097122,2012-04-08,1451757,Emi,"robin was a great host, very helpful and lovely. the room is really cozy, with a nice space, exactly as the pictures. her dog mitzy is very cute! good location, 15 minutes to the subway, malls, and great restaurants. we definitely recommend robin and her place to anyone."
198685,1110475,2012-04-12,1688206,Jenny,"robin is a very, very cool hostess, and gave us lots of great tips on how to get around washington and where to eat. the location was excellent, with many fabulous eateries within walking distance. the room was cozy and comfortable, and mitzy is the sweetest ""puppy"" ever!
all in all, we really enjoyed the stay and hanging out with robin and her friends :)"
198685,1134098,2012-04-15,2031491,Richard,robin was super nice. always had a recommendation of where to go and how to get there. location is good. close enough to metros and walkable to anywhere if you feel like it. much better than a hotel. thanks!
198685,1148148,2012-04-18,1908648,Eddie,"this was a great stay!  the room was clean and comfortable, robin was very welcoming and helpful, and it was super easy to get to all the sights from robin's place.  i definitely reccommend this to anyone!"

198685,1162927,2012-04-22,1706979,Conny & Martin,"we had a great time staying at robin´s house! alltough we had little trouble with the communication about our check-in robin is a warm, helping and open-minded person. she made us feel very welcome! when she was away for the weekend she made sure that a friend of her was there for us. to sum up: we had great conversations, met interesting people, fell in love with mitzy (her lovely dog) and felt very comfortable. "
198685,1190564,2012-04-28,1431311,Barbara,"robin is a wonderful host!!!!! i felt in her house very welcomed and comfortable! she is very sincerer and i loved her beautiful smile. all her friends were awesome as well. i did not miss anything and was even able to finish my final exam! btw, i got a- as a final grade!!!! go blue!!!
if you are looking for very affordable, but at the same comfortable, room in dc -- look no further!   "
198685,1202931,2012-04-30,1714013,Reine,"seriously???? :-) i am  so glad  i tried this experience of  renting a room for the first  time because it is far better than booking a hostel or hotel when you have a small budget. robin helped me finding my way from union station and  also from dulles for my friend coming from france to visit dc. it felt good to sleep in a house and a good bed. in spite some noise in the morning that made us wake up too early and we couldn't sleep back , we were fully satisfied.
nice neighborhood , easily accessible by bus or metro (10 to 12mn of walk)very  well located !"
198685,1232757,2012-05-06,1539789,Laurent & Anne,"nous sommes restés 5 nuits chez robin et sa chienne. nous avons passé un agréable séjour, robin nous a bien reçu  et est sympathique, accueillante et de bons conseils. dans la chambre il y a des prospectus touristiques bien utiles. l'arrêt de bus n'est pas très loin et il faut marcher 15 minutes pour se rendre à la station de métro. l'endroit est tranquille. "
198685,1272375,2012-05-13,826932,Almas,"we spent one night at robin's place so unfortunately didn't get to meet her, but her friend tizzy met us on arrival and was lovely and really helpful for our very brief stopover in dc. the room was a good size and the house was only a ten minute walk to the nearest subway. there is a dog in the house who seems scary on arrival, but she's very harmless really! the neighborhood itself is fine if traveling with someone, but i probably wouldn't recommend walking alone at night. however, a taxi from the metro station only cost us $6. overall, a good stay and very good value for money! "
198685,1306098,2012-05-19,2062408,Cathy,"robin was a wonderful, friendly and helpful hostess.  we loved staying at her house; the room was clean and comfortable and felt like home, we also appreciated the use of her kitchen. loved the neighborhood; close enough to bike around washington and interesting restaurants within walking distance."
198685,1336849,2012-05-23,2186965,Jeremy,its a really nice and cosy room and robin has been extremely helpful. pity we didn't stay longer though. 
198685,1370082,2012-05-29,1640933,Daniel,"my girlfriend and i had a great time in robin's place! the bedroom is really convinient and we could use anything we want in the apprtment. robin is a really nice person and great to talk with. she has a dog who's the cutest thing in the world! the location of the house is good, just several bus stops from the national mall. you also have a big shopping and eateries area about 15 minutes walk from the house. we had a great experience... just be sure not to park your car in front of the house during day time :)"
198685,1434396,2012-06-07,2475930,Marcin,enjoyed the stay.
198685,1451717,2012-06-10,2488237,Abbigail,we had a great experience staying at robin's house!  we were able to park our car in the back of the home and the nearest metro station was only a few blocks away.  she was very friendly and helpful and even hugged us before we left her house!  we will stay with her again!
198685,1473599,2012-06-13,2212844,Laurens,"i loved the room! it was very clean, and robin was the best host ever. i totally recommend this place! robin knows dc very well, which comes in handy when you want to find a good place to eat."
198685,1529245,2012-06-21,2342747,Shota,"robin and her friends are fun, friendly, and welcoming. 
she made sure that i felt at home and was always available to answer questions. the room was clean and spacious, the queensize bed was comfy, and the place is conveniently located to access college park and capitol hill. if i didn't have work, i would have really liked to hang out with them more. "
198685,1583560,2012-06-28,2052764,Justin,"robin was a most gracious host as well as mitsy the adorable dog. the room was clean and nicely decorated and bed was most comfortable. robin was so nice as to put in a chair and table so i could do some work while i was there. the h2,3,4 busses stop just across the street and is convenient to either the trendy downtown columbia heights or the red line metro. if you're into nice buildings, the bus passes the basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate (whew) on the way to the red line metro and is one of the most gorgeous churches i've been into."
198685,1599594,2012-07-01,1865630,Lisa,"robin has a great home. the room is very comfortable and the bed is amazing!!! she was clean and organsied, and gave us our own space. she is very nice and has a cute big friendly dog too! 15 mins to train station."

the room was like the house in a very good condition and it was easy to feel comfortable. it is located in a nice neighborhood with lots of cheap and easy possibilities to get to the town center."
198685,1759225,2012-07-21,1867426,Sophie & Vincent,we spent very good time there. robin is very friendly and helpful. she has a big heart!! the location is not so far away to downtown. thank you
198685,1824962,2012-07-28,2898424,Sarina,"my boyfriend and i absolutely loved staying at robin's and wished we could have stayed longer.  the room was very nice, and we had full access to the house, including the kitchen.  we enjoyed meeting all the other people staying in the house, and had easy access to both the columbia heights metro and bus routes. would highly recommend."
198685,1900361,2012-08-06,2545698,Julia,"robins place is very nice. we enjoyed our time in the beautiful room and we enjoyed to chat with other guests. although we met robin just one day before the end of our stay it was a pleasure to meet her. 'she is very friendly. her placeis also very clean and comfortable! good connection to all important places in washington, too. thank you!"
198685,1938776,2012-08-10,2412416,Irena,"das zimmer war sehr groß und komfortabel, leider konnte die klimaanlage nicht separat für das zimmer geregelt werden."
198685,1967452,2012-08-13,141317,Desirée,robin has a great house which is conveniently located. she gave us some good advice about where to eat and drink and was always available for questions. the room was very clean and quiet. 
198685,2000219,2012-08-16,847381,Beth,"firstly, the photos do not do the place justice! it was an incredibly cute house with spacious rooms and great company. i was only with robin for 2 nights and really wish i could have stayed longer! i felt right at home from the moment i arrived which is quite rare for me and my bedroom was so accommodating with a large bed, wardrobe, chest of drawers, dresser and mirror. i loved the company from mitzy the dog when i arrived home for the day and other guests in the house at the time were just as lovely. robin is full of information and can tell you how/where to go to experience the best of dc. i found the best way to get around was the bikeshare system, it was great with stations easily located (one just 200m up the street) and the roads are safe to ride on so getting to the national mall from the house was a very enjoyable easy ride. i would definitely recommend staying here."
198685,2016139,2012-08-17,2100658,Nolberto,robin was extremely kind. the room was clean and the bed was comfortable!
198685,2033292,2012-08-19,1272911,Daniel,"exciting stay, in nice quaters. the house is full of life and robin is ready to answer any of your questions at any given time. "
198685,2173047,2012-09-02,1710123,Rocky,we really enjoyed our stay with robin. her place is only a few minutes walk to a bus stop and a 10 minute walk to the metro station which has many shops and places to eat as well. there was parking on the street behind her house which was very convenient for those with cars. our room was very nice sized and the house was centrally air-conditioned so we were very comfortable on those hot d.c. nights. robin was a very welcoming host and has an unforgettable laugh. we would definitely stay there again.
198685,2237916,2012-09-09,2181152,Nitzan,"me and my boyfriend stayed at robin's place for 5 days,we are tourists.

robin was very nice and helpful and easy-going,when we asked her about places to go and where to hang out she gave us good recommendations.
we got a smartrip card from her,to load money on it and ride the bus and train.

we got full access to the kitchen and to the other pubic areas.
our room was very clean and private comfortable ,robin's place was very close to everything,we just take one bus (10 min ride) and we're on the tourism sites.

***problematic situations we had-
when we first arrive to robin's house our room was not prepared and the other guests were still there,which makes it difficult for us to make arrangements before we wanted to go out again to travel in the city.

***other situation we had that we came back from the city after a long day of travling and we were exhausted,and there was a very loud metal music in the morning and in the evening! (that obviously which not everybody would like of course....) and that really disturbed us.

overall, our staying at robin's place was nice, so if you're a tourist this kind of location could really help for you."
198685,2278452,2012-09-14,3164236,Massimiliano,her place is only a few minutes walk to a bus stop and a 10 minute walk to the metro station.her dog is very lovely.

the room is comfortable and clean.
robin is a nice girl and available to help you."
198685,2341242,2012-09-18,3540272,Lisa,"very cute house on a cute street (there's a front porch area and a small backyard too). robin was gracious and extremely helpful when we asked about parking last minute. the room was well decorated and comfortable. the only minor issue was the thinness of the walls, which allowed guitar playing and talking downstairs to be heard upstairs. however, people went to bed and things quieted down around 11 pm (we stayed on a sunday) so this was not a big issue for us."
198685,2342283,2012-09-19,2528396,Shana,"we just stayed for 1 evening at robin's but we had a lovely time. robin was fun, friendly and helpful. we watched tv together and played video games :) her roomies are fun too. the house is well located, the room was spacious and very clean and we could use the kitchen. we felt at home. would certainly return. this listing is a must! :)"
198685,2433591,2012-09-27,3665806,Felipe,"robin was a fantastically gracious host. the room and bathroom were clean, and she had all sorts of good information on the area ready to go.
i even got a good tour of the area, which has all sorts of amazing restaurants and bars within a 2 block radius!"
198685,2567951,2012-10-09,3736118,Cheli,"robin's place was great. she is a super sweet lady, with excellent taste. her lady puppy was so cute and friendly and playful, she hung out with us for most of our first day. robin was able to advise us on some great restaurants in the area and was very accommodating and friendly. the room was very pretty and comfortable. "
198685,2587961,2012-10-12,1699947,Ben,i had a great stay at robin's house! the room was really nicely set up and every thing like towels and the wifi password were in the room waiting for me when i arrived. the dog is really friendly and i found it easy to get into the city on the $1 bus. if i am ever back in dc again i will be booking robin's place.
198685,2633532,2012-10-16,2143730,Gaelan,"staying at robin's place was awesome! she and the people in her house were really easy to get along with, in my down time i was quite happy sitting in their place while they were having dinner, or playing with their dog, or talking to everyone.

robin is also a great resource if you're interested in what to do in washington, whether it comes to the standard tourist stuff or if you want to see where everyone drinks coffee or what you should check out in the hip non-downtown neighbourhoods."
198685,2638724,2012-10-16,1656568,Callum&Rike,"this was the only disappointing airbnb experience we have made so far. prior to our arrival, it was difficult to communicate with robin. we emailed her about our arrival time and asked if someone would be in and never heard back. we were forced to call her up the night before to sort this out. when we arrived on time at her house, we were first left on the street for ten minutes until her housemate let us into the house. he then left us standing in the living room area by the entrance while the host was in the shower. standing around for another ten minutes, we had the chance to see the ground floor of the house, which simply did not match any standards of cleanliness that you would anticipate of someone who expects guests in his/her house. by the time she had finally made it downstairs to greet us it was clear for us that we did not feel comfortable staying in the house. when we later contacted her via email about a refund of at least two of our three nights, she showed a complete lack of cooperation. instead, she took all our reasoning personal and was incapable of a professional negotiation. even though it was her unprofessional behaviour as a host, she has never returned any money to us while it was us who had the trouble of finding a different last minute accommodation and had to pay double for our three nights in washington."
198685,2763697,2012-10-30,3764868,庭維 Ting Wei,"it's so good just like at home. and the place is reachable by bus (h1~h4 for east-west and 70, 79 for north-south). we have good time there.
住在這裡就像在家一樣,房東非常外向而隨性,房間很舒適,床超舒服,而且房子前面就有東西向公車,不遠處也有南北向公車,非常非常方便!無疑是個很棒的體驗｡"
198685,2856349,2012-11-11,3752398,Katura,"we stayed here for about a week and had a very nice time. robin was very attentive and friendly, with great advice about where to eat and how to get around town by bus or by bike-share. our room felt private and clean and pretty. it came with clean towels (which made packing easier), and the bed was super-comfy! robin's housemates are friendly and fun, we enjoyed hanging out with them. mitzy the dog was a delight to play with, too!  the atmosphere of the main part of the house is very casual and social and playful, and it was nice to be able to either hang out and swap stories, or retreat to the quiet bedroom if jet-lag was getting the best of me. appreciated all the maps and books on the bedroom shelf for planning and general reading; i left another guidebook there for the next guest. "
198685,2939202,2012-11-21,3538036,Bruce,"robin was helpful, courteous and even gave me a room upgrade!  easy to find and close to just about everything.  if only i had more time in town, but now i know where to stay when i do."
198685,3011889,2012-12-03,3340802,Paulo,"robin was great, the house is cozy and the room very big. she lent me a bus pass ($5 for a new one) and told me how to go around washington. she's the type of people you want to be friends with.
in the room there is a paper with the complete address, wifi password and some other details, clean towels and a very comfortable bed."
198685,3077524,2012-12-12,4062051,Carly,"robin's place was awesome! her house is conveniently located and cozy. robin is a very hospitable host and gave us tips on how to get around, restaurant recommendations, and insights on the nightlife. her dog mitzie is just as sweet as she is. we'll be staying here again on our next trip to dc!"
198685,3105042,2012-12-17,4235374,Arielle,"we had a lovely stay in robin's house! she gave us helpful tips that helped us maximize our enjoyment of dc, and we very much appreciated her warm welcome!"
198685,3211931,2013-01-01,4359292,Smita,"i enjoyed staying at robin's cozy house - she was such a gracious and warm host, she made us feel at home right away.
she had everything very neatly organized - right from the maps of various sections of town, bus routes, and everything we needed to know. she had thought of everything.
i would definitely stay there again. 
thank you robin, we had a great time at dc thanks to you and your lovely daughter and mitzy.

"
198685,3235815,2013-01-02,4499285,Thomas,"i stayed with a friend at robin's place for nye. robin is so nice and friendly, and will give advices of what to do. the room is not big, but this is what you need.
the location of the apartment is also very convenient, as it is just 3 min walk for the bus stop which will bring you directly to the mall.
thank robin !"
198685,3286823,2013-01-06,3710901,Jerry,robin is a very thoughtful host! she prepared everything we needed in the room which we really appreciate it. we also enjoyed our freedom with own keys. the room itself is reachable from central d.c. about 15 mins by bus.
198685,3371301,2013-01-19,4318527,Alexis,"our trip was amazing!  everyone at the house was so welcoming and sweet.  anything we needed help with or were even curious about, there was someone to help!  i plan on staying there every time i got to dc :)"
198685,3397481,2013-01-22,4594314,Marcus,"robin is an excellent host! 

a work colleague and i were in d.c for the inauguration and i contacted robin about a week before from helsinki to get accommodations.  she responded very quickly and a reading of her reviews put my mind at ease. 

her home is very warn and clean and has a view of the washington monument out of the kitchen window!  even though we only stayed for the night before the inauguration she let us leave our bags at her house all day so that we wouldn't have to tote them around d.c. all day. she aims to please!  her dog, mitzy is a sweetheart. we would definitely rent from her again.  she is very cool and a great host! thanks robin!"
198685,4210670,2013-04-19,4399562,Miguel,"i stayed at the house for three months, so i pretty much went through every situation possible really and can honestly say that this was a great experience. the photos of the room really don't do it justice, as it is much bigger than it seems in the photos. robin keeps the house very clean and takes good care of the room. the house provides all the amenities of a home (kitchen, fridge/freezer space, washing machine/dryer), so it is perfect for anyone staying in d.c. for long term. the house is situated in a great neighborhood, very close to u street and other popular areas of the city.

robin is a very considerate host, she is always ready to help answer questions about the city and always knows the best places to eat and hang out. she is a great person (and a good laugh too!)
i made a lot of good friends while i was at the house, and i will definitely be returning. "
198685,4303462,2013-04-26,190583,Will,"a great place to stay. we spent four nights here and absolutely loved it. comfortable bedroom and a nice tidy house. robin was a great host, and mitzy was a pleasure to have around. easy to get into central dc by bus, metro or the bike share and some great restaurants and bars close by. 

highly recommended. "
198685,4432328,2013-05-05,14520,Erin,"robin's place was very comfortable for the one night we stayed there. checking in was convenient, and since it was friday evening, we were able to park directly in front of her house on the street (parking is restricted to permit holders during the day on weekdays). robin wasn't home, but her dog mitzy was an enthusiastic hostess, and her roommates helped us find our way around, including a recommendation for a great vegan restaurant up the street. loved the granola and ginger breakfast cereal, too."
198685,6783864,2013-08-25,2047632,Steve,robin's place is great! she is a fantastic host and the place is artfully decorated and brilliantly located.  what more could you ask for?

198685,7025815,2013-09-03,8091813,Maria,"we stayed at robin's house two times in a span of a week or so - before heading to phili and nyc and afterwards. second time around it was like going home already. robin appeared as a very friendly and considerate person. the house has somewhat of a bohemian feel about it and a lot of colour. it was conveniently located for the bus trips to the center, with a direct route running to the archives. the columbia heights neighbourhood has nice grills where you can get traditional grits, half-smokes etc to start you off in the morning. "
198685,7148115,2013-09-08,2589459,Anaïs,"great host, welcoming. thanks for subway card. the room is very cosy and clean as the bathroom. i recommend ! "
198685,7278152,2013-09-14,7460842,Izabela,"we stayed at robin's apartment for 5 nights. everything was fine. the bus stop is really close, only 3-5 minutes away and it will take you to the downtown.

198685,7558786,2013-09-24,8368229,Adrian,great host and great location. if you want to do go to the smithonian museums during the day and listen to live jazz at night you couldn't find a better place. robin and scott are welcoming and very laid back and mitzy is a charmer. highly recommended!
198685,7630857,2013-09-27,8784370,Tanya,"i stayed just two nights but i really enjoyed this time. the room was nice, clean and tidy. i felt like at home. robin gave me a lot of useful information about the transport in washington and getting downtown. everything was perfect. thank you !  :))"
198685,7945689,2013-10-09,4659452,Melanie,we enjoyed our stay at robin's. the room was cozy and quiet and the  wifi worked great. it didn't really feel like we were sharing the home with others because we were usually there at different hours. robin's dog mitzy is also adorable!
198685,9016635,2013-12-02,675949,Arun,great host with a cool dog! ended up staying for an extended period. highly reccomended. 
201116,536765,2011-09-16,740991,Jon,"exceptional host, reed was very friendly and went far beyond including having breakfast prepared for us every morning! the location is a little far out, but that said it is very close to the metro and only a short train ride to all washington has to offer. note this is a basement suite, it is very dark but quiet, private and clean with seperate entry. would be fun to stay during the weekend, reed had alot of tips and information on where to go, eat and what to do. reed is very social and fun, but respected our privacy. would definately reccomend anyone staying in dc, a great and cheaper alternative to a hotel. hope to stay again."
201116,605920,2011-10-07,411599,Stephanie,"this was a perfect place to stay for my night in dc. it was very convenient to dc national (reagan) airport, a short walk from a red line stop of the metro. the space was roomy, comfortable and clean. reed provided everything i needed, and was very attentive, friendly and nice (also she is a talented artist!). the neighborhood is charming and quiet, filled with beautiful trees. i liked having the separate entrance. thanks for a great stay, reed! i would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends."
201116,617107,2011-10-10,655450,Tara,"perfect place for me and my boyfriend to stay while visiting my parents in takoma park, and reed was the perfect hostess!  when we were in a rush, we was hands-off; and when we needed anything, she was attentive and very quick to respond.  i'd recommend it to my family, friends, and anyone else who wants to be conveniently located around the corner from red-line metro and the vibrant historic takoma park main streets, thrift shops, and cafes. we'll look forward to staying at the victorian haven again :)"
201116,687866,2011-11-02,955115,Steve,"reed was the best.  my travel plans got screwed up, so i had to come in super late (11:30pm), but reed said no problem and was able to get me checked in!

it's around a 6 minute walk or so from the house to the takoma metro station, which brings you into downtown dc in around 20 minutes.

the basement apartment itself is very nice and clean - there's a dorm-sized fridge, stove top, oven, and microwave.  tv with cable and dvd player...wireless internet worked great.

just remember it is a basement apartment, so there's no natural light in the bedroom...make sure you bring an alarm clock if you need to wake up early, as it's tough to tell what time it is without one!

reed was a great host, and i thoroughly enjoyed my stay there.  she even dropped off some coupons for discounts in case i was heading to the movie theater.  thanks again!"
201116,728412,2011-11-18,1374850,Kath,"nothing could have prepared me for the experience i had at reed’s beautiful victoria haven apartment. this was my first time using airbnb to find a place to stay for a few days. i am from australia and was on my first visit to the us when i stayed at victoria haven. i really wanted to find a good place to stay when i was in washington dc and truly, i landed on my feet. 

what was special for me was meeting reed herself. i could not have asked for a more gracious, delightful, respectful and generous host. nothing was too much trouble for reed, whether it was providing me with things i needed from her own kitchen to make my stay more comfortable or introducing me to the best ways to get around the neighbourhood. the village of takoma park is great to walk around, with excellent restaurants (try mark’s kitchen and soupergirl for cheap, nutritious meals), a sunday farmers’ market and great shops – and the metro is so close you are downtown in 15 minutes. 

the apartment itself is very comfortable, warm and beautifully decorated. there is plenty of storage in the bedroom and the living area is a spacious and an elegant space to relax in. you have your own entrance straight on to the garden. while you can have as much independence as you want, you also have that lovely feeling that you are sharing a beautiful house that is cherished by its owner. the apartment is also incredibly good value, especially given the location and the convenience. i would highly recommend victoria haven to anyone. thank you reed for making my stay with you one of the highlights of my trip. i hope to be back someday!"
201116,1039354,2012-03-25,606010,Yasmeen,"i had the absolute good fortune and pleasure of staying with reed at the aptly named victorian haven for six weeks. i had a rotation scheduled at a nearby hospital and needed to find a place for myself and my cat to roost on relatively short notice as my initial arrangements fell through. and, as always, airbnb came through! where to begin? reed's basement apartment was utterly perfect for my needs in every way. it was completely self contained with it's own separate entrance from the lovely garden in the back of the house. the living area was huge with it's own very nice plasma tv with cable that i wish i'd had time to make more use of. the bed was very comfy and reed supplied a wonderful comforter (there was still snow on the ground when i initially arrived in d.c.) that kept me toasty when it was cold outside. i also appreciated thate i could also control the temperature in the basement separately from the rest of the house. there was more than enough closet space to store my things during my stay. she also has a washer and dryer available for use in an adjoining room to the basement apartment that was incredibly convenient for me since i was there for such an extended period of time. i cooked almost every day i was there and there was plenty of cabinet space to store dishes and such in addition to a microwave, fridge and oven/stove in a fully functioning kitchen. the apartment was also very tastefully and elegantly decorated with victorian style furniture and paintings and photos from her art students. honestly, it was just a lovely place to spend a month and a half. reed herself was always available through text if i ever had any questions and was always quick to respond. she is quite knowledgable about the surrounding area and if you are interested she is glad to share with you. i count myself incredibly lucky for her chancing upon my standby request as i not only found a wonderful place to call temporary home but made a new friend as well! it was wonderful to get to know her and we had some excellent conversations. victorian haven is located literally less than five minutes away from the metro red line takoma station which made commuting so easy for me. you can travel anywhere the metro can take you quite easily! if you are staying for longer than a day or so i would recommend buying a smarttrip card. even if you don't take the metro anywhere the immediate area of old takoma park is a lovely area in and of itself to explore. there are several nice places to eat in easy walking distance. there is a library on the corner and a nice track at a high school about ten minutes walking distance down the road. there is also a rec center with a huge pool and gym that is free..."
201116,1087194,2012-04-05,1963499,Jamie,reed (our host) was extremely welcoming and friendly. she was able to meet all our requests and provided a wealth of information regarding local amenities. the property is very convenient to takoma park metro station and was easy to find. the apartment has it's own main door so you can come and go as you please. as it's a basement the steps down to the door are a bit tricky - especially at night. reed was happy to let us use the garden when we wanted to. all in all we thoroughly enjoyed a very relaxed stay.  
201116,1151729,2012-04-19,1861824,Amanda,"reed's victorian basement was a great place to stay when visiting washington. it is in a very quiet neighbourhood with lovely gardens and houses. the metro station is just 4 minutes walk from the house. the flat has everything 2 people need. we loved the red satin sheets! we had breakfast in the garden on the first day. reed was very friendly, it's a shame we were so busy that we didn't see more of her."
201116,1356786,2012-05-27,2012617,Kristian,"reed was the consummate hostess!  she was always sure to tend to our every need - and was always quick to offer suggestions for places to visit and things to do.  we really enjoyed her courtyard area.  her home is in a nice, quiet neighborhood and access to the metro was super easy. "
201116,1380144,2012-05-29,1910332,Gwendolyn,ms. reed went above and beyond! the place is kempt and described perfectly. she is an excellent host. i highly recommend her.
201116,1880042,2012-08-03,1390386,Jared,reed was a wonderful host and the unit is as described in the profile.  my wife and i look forward to staying there again soon.
201116,1989476,2012-08-14,3190883,Paige,"we stayed with reed this past weekend while my boyfriend was checking out homes to possibly rent in takoma park. reed was very sweet, cheerful, hospitable, and her location is great for exploring the area. an extra bonus is that we were able to bring our dog along with us. thank you for a great stay reed!"
201116,2309493,2012-09-17,3249162,Amanda,"overall i really enjoyed staying at victorian haven - reed was a delightful hostess. she was very responsive to my inquiries and quick to assist whenever i had any issues (ran out of garbage bags, had some light bulbs die on me). as a newcomer to the dc area, she was very welcoming and kind and checked in with me occassionally to make sure that i was adjusting well and was not having issues with the metro, finding grocery stores etc. the apartment itself was also nice - very clean and very close to the metro (which was perfect for me since i had no car). there was an occassional rogue cricket roaming about, but those were few and far between."
201116,2345919,2012-09-19,1547603,Kate,"reed is a kind and caring host, and was very concerned about making our experience in dc the best.  she thoughtfully put out some chocolates before we arrived, and gave us snacks before we left.  the apartment is an easy five minute walk to the takoma metro station.  her neighborhood consists of some lovely old victorian houses.  tip: the restaurant my little bistro (you'll walk past it right before you get to the metro) has a delicious and cheap breakfast.  the apartment is clean, and would be good for a long term stay, as it has a kitchen, wi-fi, and living room.  one thing i might recommend for the apartment is a dehumidifier, as basements often tend to be a bit damp.  the free parking is a big plus in dc.  overall, a great value.  thanks reed!"
201116,2437357,2012-09-28,1805611,Derek,"brilliant. once we got used to basement living it was wonderful and so was reed.
just like everybody else says.

it's a safe, cool beautiful characterful area.
we especially loved whiling away the morning, having breakfast in the garden. made us late every day!

we also loved the art works on the walls.
reed is an excellent host and a lovely woman.
and we enjoyed the time we spent with her very much.

the subway is close by and ""superwoman"" opposite the subway is a great place for, guess what soup! .there are also a a bar and a bistro next door to the subway stop. door to door downtown takes about half an hour and the subway is not crowded. we always got a seat. 

shopping for food at safeways is near by and so is wholefoods.
not to mention imax cinema, restaurants and shops.
off street parking.

we loved dc and takoma.

our sat nav took us right through dc so watch out for misdirection.

enjoy."
201116,2639943,2012-10-17,1934401,Lee,"we just returned from an amazing week at reed's victorian haven!  our hostess was thoughtful, helpful, and went out of her way to make our visit enjoyable.  reed let us know that she was available if we needed her, but otherwise she  gave us our privacy.the basement apartment was comfortable for the two of us.  there was plenty of seating, a comfortable bed, and enough basic kitchenware to cook a meal.  we walked to safeway to purchase a few groceries and found the trip to be quite manageable.  victorian haven is located  a short 10 minutes (or less) from the takoma metro station.  we would recommend this apartment for your visit to our nation's capitol!"
201116,3312809,2013-01-08,1974898,Christelle,"reed was the perfect hostess! she welcomed us at our arrival, and pointed us to some restaurants and stores around the area! (she even provided us with some fresh eggs for making breakfast the next day!!!). she was attentive to all our inquiries, and made sure we felt comfortable and well settled in! it was a wonderful experience that i highly recommend to anyone traveling to the dc area, and looking for a place to stay!!!"
201116,3400140,2013-01-23,4090192,Vicky,"we could not have asked for a kinder, more gracious host.  reed was very sweet and touched base with me the day before we arrived.  she let us know that there was a chance that she would be gone before we got there, and when we arrived, she had written us a list of helpful tips about the apartment and the area (like safeway is a few blocks away, and there was a safeway card in one of the drawers to use).  reed was gone for the majority of our stay, but she was always available via text or a call.

the apartment itself is a basement unit that's connected to the main house, but there is a separate entrance.  it's clean, and there is a stove, microwave, sink and refrigerator, so perfect if you want to keep some food handy.  there are some soaps, shampoo/conditioner and lotion in the bathroom cabinet, and fresh towels and sheets.  oh, and the heater was super appreciated when we came back inside from the dc winter!

the neighborhood is quiet, and the apartment is only three blocks away from the takoma metro station, where the red line will take you right downtown within 20 minutes.  we would definitely stay here again!

helpful tip: this would be a great place if you plan on having a car with you."
201116,3564631,2013-02-17,3801972,Camille,reed was a very welcoming and wonderful host! the apartment was a very clean and was overall a great place to stay. i would definitely stay here again. thank you reed!
201116,3818148,2013-03-18,4943640,Remon,"this place is an absolute gem. it's a beautiful historic house in a charming and historic neighborhood. reed is an exceptional host, who made absolutely sure that i would have a nice stay. the location is great with the train station literally a couple blocks away... in minutes you can be in downtown dc. also, for those coming to silver spring for the airp course, this is definitely a good option, as i was able to walk to the course (about half an hour), and public transport is quick on days that are too cold or rainy. overall, i highly recommend this place and would stay here again in a heartbeat. 
"
201116,4106061,2013-04-10,4555843,Tami,"we are a young family that lived in dc for several years, then moved away. this was our first visit back after 4 years and we brought our two kids (3 years old and 1 year old) and my sister. there was a master bedroom with a double bed and two dressers, a living room with two couches - one being a fold out single bed. there was television with cable and wifi as well, which was so helpful with the kids! there is a tiny kitchen with an oven and a stovetop, a microwave, small fridge and sink. there was also a small coffee maker, and various utensils and cooking staples (sugar, etc.) in the cabinets. the bathroom has a shower stall. 

anyway, reed was great! we rarely saw her, but she was available via text and was super-helpful. she let us park in the driveway on the weekdays since the street parking is only 2 hours during the day or you need a permit. 

reed provided us with sheets, blankets, pillows and towels and let us use her washer and dryer, which was also a huge help with the kids. 

nice, quiet neighborhood. 5 minute walk to the takoma park metro on the red line. it was excellent!"
201116,4158490,2013-04-15,5005038,Brian,"reed's place was the perfect home for my parents visiting dc for the cherry blossom festival! i can't say enough about it, and i'll be telling all my friends in the neighborhood to have their guests stay with her. the apartment was as clean, cozy, and well-prepared as advertised, and reed was very accommodating all around. check-in and check-out was a total breeze, and she even let us borrow her cooler for a daytrip out of town. as far as i'm concerned, this is the absolute best place to stay in the takoma-brightwood area, bar none! thanks again reed!"
201116,4216008,2013-04-19,1292571,Hoda,"reed is a great host. i enjoyed staying there. the place was really clean/neat and calm. and the location is great, its close to all type of transportations. she has a really nice personality and really helpful. i highly recommend her.   "

the room was very comfy and i couldn't have asked for more.  the only glitch, as far as i am concerned, was the weak wifi signal in the room (and i'd loose it frequently) but it worked perfectly in the living room."
204741,656402,2011-10-23,955903,Hugues,"this first experience with airbnb was delightful thanks to denise and pete's kindness. the room is really clean, comfortable, and their precious advices will help you to discover dc if, like me, you are visiting the city."

she was king=d enough to drive me to downtown each morning and even gave me a train pass to use which saved me money!
the bed was comfortable and tv was great right in my own bedroom.
her boyfrend went out of his way to meet me the 2nd day and drove me home with some inconvenience to him. i really appreciated it."
204741,711538,2011-11-12,1261508,Naomi,we stayed with denise for two nights she was a sweet and good host. when we called her that we had arrived she was still at here work but came home immidiatily. we had a great time in dc.
204741,727734,2011-11-18,1198388,Lauren,"short story: amazing! these are friendly, generous, wonderful people who i would love to stay with again.

long story: denise had offered to pick me up from the bus station when i arrived but was unable to so, instead of letting me find my own way there, she sent her very sweet friend glen to pick me up. he took me to the grocery store so i could get some dinner in and helped me settle in to denise's place. the apartment is lovely, full of souvenirs from all over, denise has lead a very interesting life! it's quiet and the room is out of the way so you get lots of privacy. this was only my second time staying at an airbnb location and having had a pretty horrible experience for my first in nyc, i was anxious about how this was going to turn out. but denise and pete were so lovely. denise took me shopping for clothes and treated me to a meal out!!! i got sick and she took care of me!!! they drove me pretty much to wherever i needed to go and for all this i will be eternally grateful. denise did not 'have' to do all of this for me, but she is the sort of person who will do everything she can to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

denise's place doesn't score well for location as its a but of a way out of the centre (about 10-15mins drive) but the local public transport is excellent and runs pretty much 24hours. plus if you're happy to ride in with them in the morning and home with them at around 4.30-5ish then they are happy to take you. they work right next to the national mall!!!

there is so much more i could say about these guys but in a nutshell; they are friendly, intelligent, generous people who love to help others. they are chatty but very respectful of space. the apartment is clean and tidy (and they have a cute kitty), quiet and private. the bed is sooooo comfy and the room large but cozy. there's nothing more that they could have done for me. we shared meals together and talked for hours. it was like staying with friends.

hope to see you guys soon!!!"
204741,738988,2011-11-22,1418598,Christina,"what a cozy space!  although off the beaten path - the room and host were the most!  denise has done a great job of creating a cozy nook in her abode to share with airbnb guests.  double bed, access to cable and internet, coffee in the am.  she even let me launder  a load of clothes and store my rental bike.  diverse neighborhood with limited retail."
204741,748633,2011-11-28,1154976,Laura,"we are two girls from germany and we stayed at denise’s place for four nights in order to do sightseeing in washington. we really enjoyed our stay in denise’s apartment and would definitely do it again. her boyfriend, pete, picked us up from the bus station and denise provided a warm meal for us what was really nice. in the morning we had the possibility to drive with denise to the city because she is working near the mall. she did everything to make us feel comfortable and was helpful at any time.  our room and the bathroom were really clean what was really important for us. we had really nice conversations with her because she is very open-minded and interested in other countries and cultures. moreover she lived in germany for a couple of years.
we want to mention that her place is not downtown; it is in a suburb of washington.  but the ride with the metro (southern avenue station) only takes 10 minutes and the metro is driving quite regularly. in the case that denise can’t pick you up from the metro station, we would recommend, especially for women, to take a cab (5 min drive, around 10$).
in total, we can recommend to stay there as it is a good price-performance ratio. we are thanking denise for her hospitality and hope to see her one day in germany :)
"
204741,777380,2011-12-11,1455605,Daniel,"i had a fantastic time staying at denise and pete's condo in washington, d.c. from the time i booked until the day i left dc, denise was a great help and was very hospitable. she provided me with maps of the region, transportation timetables and also lent me a dc metro card for me to use on the subway and buses. i found the room spacious and very clean with hotel-grade amenities including cable tv. overall, i had a wonderful and relaxing time. i would definitely recommend staying with denise and pete!"
204741,787163,2011-12-15,1475761,Tony, the bed was nice to sleep in and denise helped me when i needed it. 
204741,794060,2011-12-19,1474216,Katarina,"denise and pete are wonderful, giving, and caring people. their place is very sweet and the room is lovely- very comfy bed and nice and private feeling. denise made jay and i breakfast 2 mornings- which was an added thoughtful and very delicious bonus! denise is also very good at giving directions/helpful at explaining the ins-and-outs of dc. the one downside i would say is that since her place is further afield from the tourist sights, i wouldn't have felt comfortable taking public transport alone to her place at night. this was fine because jay and i were together, but for solo travelers you might want to consider how late you'll be getting back to denise's place. thanks so much denise and pete for a great 3 nights!"
204741,801659,2011-12-23,1433354,Xue Ting,"we had an awesome stay at denise's place. the room is exactly like what you see in the photo, plus a tv, wardrobe, dressing table, ample shelves, rocking chair etc. everything you need for a comfortable space. the bed is also really really comfortable, so much so that when we intended to take a short nap at 7pm, we ended up sleeping all the way to 5am! the only slight problem with the room is there isn't much floor space to put big luggages. the bathtub was choked on the first night we stayed but the plumber rectified the problem the next day. also, denise was very nice to let us use her ingredients and some of her food and drinks when we cooked. getting a ride to town from her in the mornings also helped us to save some money. dc is quite small so it was easy to get to and from her place. denise and her friend pete are very welcoming hosts and easy to talk to as well. we enjoyed looking at her collections on the walls and cabinets in the house - very interesting! her house may be a little small but is very cosy and tastefully furnished. the space is put to very good use! to top it off the place is very good value for money. highly recommended!"
204741,854114,2012-01-10,1250099,Rasmus,"my stay with denise was a good one. she was really friendly and helpful. she picked me up at the train station, and even drove me around to show me where to find bus stop etc.
the room was nice, the bed was comfortable, and the coffee was great!
getting back and forth from her house to d.c. was easy enough, though a little time consuming."
204741,947615,2012-02-26,1482618,Justin,i am a medical student who was doing a psychiatry rotation at the nearby st. elizabeth's hospital. the location of the apartment was very close and met my needs for my six week stay. ms. denise and mr. pete were great hosts and wonderful conversationalists. my overall experience was very good.
204741,978465,2012-03-07,1722553,Xianfang,"denise's place is exactly the same as you could see from the web. we had a really good time staying with denise. you could not imagine how friendly and helpful denise is. although we were landing very late at night, she picked us up from dca, which we greatly appreciated. when she learned that we had not had dinner, she cooked us noodle soup. besides showing us around dc during driving us to and from her place, she even let us use her own metro smart card for our convenience. we also like her cream puff, a cute and also friendly friend. you would not feel regret choosing her place to stay. the bed is really really comfortable, everything is clean. we also like the decorative style in the private room as well. transportation is a little bit confusing at the first beginning, but everything was clear enough when we went through it. i would also say if we go dc next time, we will definitely choose denise and cream puff's place."
204741,984168,2012-03-09,1699092,Katharina,our stay at denise was very good. the place looks as described in the internet. we had a good night sleep and spent a wonderful day in dc. 
204741,999423,2012-03-14,1678546,Mitch,"suburbia in the city was a wonderful experience from start to finish! my wife and i came to dc for a class trip/getaway and couldn't have been more pleased with our stay and our hosts! the descriptions by denise are very accurate. we felt right at home with our own private room, use of the kitchen, and even a friendly cat to greet you (the cat is kept out of your room so no worries if you're allergic.)

it was fun to stay right near to dc in a neighborhood rather than a big box hotel in the middle of town. after denise picked us up from union station, she showed us which bus stops to use and explained the subway system. after that we freely and easily explored all of dc - aided by the generously provided metropass cards!

we can't thank denise enough for a wonderful stay and would definitely stay again the next time we find ourselves in dc! i sure anyone else would love their stay as well!"
204741,1038294,2012-03-24,1848471,Trina,"yes, it really is a ""best value"" as far as we are concerned.  we were very pleased with the location and the clean, well appointed accommodations.  

everything was exceptionally clean and neat.  and, denise and her assistants made our visit most pleasurable, accommodating us in every way possible.  

we would definitely stay there again."
204741,1058318,2012-03-29,1811371,Jenny,"thanks to denise, peter and her assistand glenn i had an amazing stay in washington. they were very friendly and i enjoyed chatting with them about germany, the us and so on. my friend and i were also very grateful for the pick-up service from / to washington union station. last but not least, the room was clean, the bed was super-comfy and even the cranky cat won my heart :-) 
if i had the chance to go back to washington i'd definitely stay at denise's once again.
"
204741,1102860,2012-04-09,1851454,Alexandra,"this was my first experience with airbnb and it couldn't have been better! the room was very spacious and clean. the bed was super comfy. denise was very helpful and she even picked me up from the metro station when i once came back after dark. the bus/metro connection downtown is easy and fast.
the cat is adorable and very friendly. if i ever visit washington dc again i would definitely book with denise. thanks a lot for everything!"
204741,1158273,2012-04-21,1798334,Mary C,"it was everything denise said it would be. nice neighborhood, easy access to bus and train to dc/national mall area.denise and pete were friendly and helpful with directions. we enjoyed our stay and would come again."
204741,1230192,2012-05-05,2054335,Salic,"staying with denise apartment is like you went home from your travel. glen meet us at l'enfant metro and bring us home with our luggage, he gave us the set of keys for the apartment and since it's still early afternoon glen brought us back downtown for a short tour. during our 4 nights stay in denise apartment pete sleep in the other room for the first 2 nights to make our stay comfortable, on the 3rd night denise arrived and cook food for our dinner, on the 4th night we owned the whole apartment, that shows how denise trust her guest. we appreciated very much the kindness of both denise and glen. glen even drop us to the station and i'm sure he will do more if he is free during our short trip in washington dc. denise apartment is very clean and i'm sure i'll stay there again if i can return back to washington dc."
204741,1237390,2012-05-07,1552986,Nicole,"clean, cozy bed and incredibly close to the sights. unfortunately, i could not meet denise personally. but therefore glen helped me a lot, thank you! and washington is really great. :)"
204741,1258491,2012-05-10,2147252,Linh,"i'ts a great place to be, very easy to get back and forth from the city.  the hosts are very nice. if you go to dc, i highly recommend it."
204741,1278571,2012-05-14,2182529,Jackson,"we had the whole house to ourselves during our stay at denise's place as she wasn't in town over the weekend. this shows the amount of trust that denise puts in her guest. although she wasn't present, glen ensured that everything went smoothly. we were very glad that glen offered to drive us to buy our groceries so that we could cook during our stay at denise's. we are also very grateful that glen drove us to the airport early on a sunday morning to catch our morning flight at a reasonable fee. denise's  apartment is located in a very quiet and nice neighborhood. everyday, we met people who helped us in some way in her neighborhood. denise has a very nice and cozy house and the room was perfect! the bed was very comfortable and the room has satellite tv with a dvd player and also a whole collection of movies that you can watch! what i really like is that denise has all the tourist information brochures, maps, bus/metro schedules all ready in the room for us! the room and the whole house was also very neat, tidy and clean! her kitchen was also very well-stocked for cooking! denise's apartment is not really within walking distance to any metro station but with planning using the bus schedules that she provides, you can ensure that you catch the bus to the metro station at specific timings to eliminate wasting time waiting for the bus. i really enjoyed my stay at denise's and i strongly recommend her place!"
204741,1372225,2012-05-29,1993590,Gray,"it really is a ""best value"" as far as we are concerned. we were ok with the location and the clean, well appointed accommodations. everything was clean and neat. denise was out of town while we were there, so we had the place to ourselves - which wasn't much... considering we were out on the town from 10am to about 11pm each night. a great first time airbnb experience."
204741,1390372,2012-05-31,1808592,Yuan,"very nice room, denise thoughtfully prepared maps for me, easy to take bus, though a little far from downtown. good value."

"
204741,1415582,2012-06-04,2463980,Jennifer,"thank you denise. you made my stay in washington dc so enjoyable. the perfect host and nothing was too much trouble. made my sightseeing days easy to get started. the room was very comfortable and everything you could need. transport to and from the centre of washington was made easy with denise's directions, not central but really not a problem to get to. a great stay, thank you again denise."
204741,1477919,2012-06-14,569477,Enrico,"having spent 20 days on my own in dc for business i had a great stay in the best address in dc! denise was a good host and made the whole experience easy and welcoming. the room is cozy, clean and fully organized as kitchen and bathroom. hope to come back here one day to meet again denise, pete and my best friend creampuff!
denise is a great host and very attentive, highly reccomended."
204741,1573788,2012-06-27,2111709,Cecile,"our experience in washington dc was wonderful.
denise wasn't in town when we arrived on saturday but glen came to pick us up at reagan airport. also when we left denise drop us off at l'enfant plaza to catch the bus to dulles airport. it was a great help for us knowing we had 2 big suitcases and 2 little ones.
the room was comfy and cozy and denise's cat is adorable! there was a full documentation in the room that was really helpful to visit dc."
204741,1633767,2012-07-05,1930288,Dario,"staying at denise's was more than wonderful experience. the condo was cozy, comfortable, and i had everything at disposal. denise was of utomost help cause she provided me with map, metro cards, and worthwhile suggestions. i recommend denise's place to every traveler who wants a accomodation which provides more value than it actually costs."
204741,1676612,2012-07-10,1522631,Fernando,"we had a wonderful stay. the place was perfect, very clean, the neighborhood full of friendly people. very easy to use the public transportation, the bus stops is in the corner. the cat is a wonderful host, very cuddly. we would have liked to meet denise, but she was not in town, but met glenn, who was extremely kind to us. i totally recommend this place, which will go back someday.
"
204741,1925140,2012-08-08,2861309,Olga,"we arrived on saturday and denise was out of washington, but glenn met us very friendly and explained how to get to the apartment as well as provided the keys and metro cards. 
the apartment was unbelievably cosy and comfortable, everything was ready for out stay and also the most friendly cat in the world welcomed us.
denise came only on monday, but appeared very friendly and kind. everything is great with this apartment (except for the location: it's very faraway from metro, but there is a bus right on the corner that takes you right to the subway station), so we would highly recommend it to everyone who dreams about a good (and ""feel-at-home"") stay in dc."
204741,2159052,2012-09-01,2780826,Désirée,denise was a very nice host. she picked me up at the metro station and gave me a ride when i was leaving. she helped me find my way around her neighbourhood and was always very helpful. i would definetly recommend her home for airbnb guests and would stay there again. her cat creampuff made me feel very welcome!
204741,2225165,2012-09-07,3376550,Paul,"had a terrific stay.  once i learned my way around, the location was good for me.  the kitchen was great and the room was comfortable.  i'd stay there again without hesitation."
204741,2323203,2012-09-17,3086816,Lee,"denise was a nice and welcoming host, who kindly arranged to collect and drop us at union station. 
the room is clean and comfortable and great value for money. 
it was a little further from downtown than we had expected, with not much to do in the neighbourhood. having said that, the bus that takes you to the city metro line is only at the end of the road. it takes about 45-50 minutes to get to downtown. 
if you are on a budget and plan to spend most time in the city then denise's place works as a good base and we recommend it. "
204741,2398418,2012-09-24,3460845,Madlene,"our stay at denise's was one of the best during our trip through the us. the appartment and the room were very clean and i never slept so well in a bed that wasn't my own. denise was super helpful - everything worked out great (metro-cards, keys,...) she even dropped us at the bus station when we left!!"
204741,2475612,2012-10-01,3603395,Gabriele,"denise ist eine sehr nette dame, die uns sehr freundlich entgegen gekommen ist . wir hatten ein sehr nettes frühstück mit ihr. das zimmer war sehr gemütlich und crempuff (kater) ein reizender hausgenosse. wir würden jederzeit gern wieder dort wohnen."
204741,2610442,2012-10-15,1976935,Jacqueline,"denise is a wonderful host. we felt at home immediately! the place is clean and uniquely decorated. having lived in germany we found many swwet souveniers from berlin -  it was funny to be surrounded by all that stuff in the u.s. ;)
her assistant glen picked us up from the airport - he is an angel! whenever we needed anything he was there.
creamy puff was our room mate; she is a darling cat . 
"
204741,2741288,2012-10-28,66318,Paul,"comfy bed, clean and cozy room, all the amenities one could want with a cute cat to boot! unfortunately my girlfriend wasn't well so we were ships in the night with denise but we thank her for having us. being picked up from the airport was great, especially as we were delayed, we really appreciated that!"
204741,2805275,2012-11-05,3660366,Zulema,"horrible!  rent anywhere else!  this host cancelled our reservation hours before we were due to arrive.  our trip was delayed, through no fault of our own, and she became verbally abusive. 

since we didn't stay there, i had to specifically request the ability to review her.

we were in a car accident on the way to the airport (an 18-wheeler blew a tire and the tire hit our vehicle).  this woman's uncaring and thoughtless response to our accident and subsequent travel delay was to cancel our reservation and insult us while doing it.  she kept sending email after email to the point of harassment. 

i should have realized the type of person she was after reading her house rules.  check them out to get a feel for how uptight she is.

do not put yourself through the unpleasant experience of dealing with this woman.  i strongly recommend saving yourself the task of dealing with denise and just going and having a wonderful stay somewhere else.

happy vacationing, fellow travelers!"
204741,2862517,2012-11-12,3525997,Sara,"we had a good experience at denise´s flat...first at all her assistant picked us up at the station, then he show us the flat and told us that denise was away and we would be alone at the flat,,,
the flat is really nice and very clean and we could use the facilities...
there is a bus 5m walk from the house so it is great to go to the center...
thanks for all denise :)"
204741,2943894,2012-11-22,3649858,Kerstin,"the stay with denise was great! enjoyed it and also enjoyed dc soo much, it was my first time so there was lots to discover!
right at the beginning i was picked up by a friend of denise from the bus station, so i didn't have to worry about how to get to the flat :) from there she always could drop me off in the morning at the city centre when she was on her way to work. the flat itself is around 20-40 minutes away from the centre (i guess it depends a bit on the connections you might get), but it was still totally easy to get there, not a big problem at all.
a great help was the map and the metro card that denise has there for you, perfect for the start and to get around really easy. loved it :)
and the cat is super cute!
even at the end when i was going to ny she offered me a ride, cause she and her friends also went there at the same time - and they made sure that i would get all my luggage in the ny metro that evening and helped me to change the line before our ways parted. that was really super nice, since it was already a bit late."
204741,2985006,2012-11-27,2478098,Sian,"my partner and i really enjoyed staying with denise. she was really friendly, kind and helpful. the room was great, it was nice and clean and the bed was comfy. we were also always able to find street parking for those of you with a car. we highly recommend staying with denise!!"
204741,3053575,2012-12-09,4293288,Mohammad,"denise was a very kind host. we enjoyed our stay in dc. there we had our completely private room which was a plus. she also does the second ""b"" in airbnb which is the breakfast! you usually do not get breakfast anywhere else. there is a downside about denise's place which is its location. it's far from dc. however, she gave us several rides to/from dc including ride in 5am to the train station!! thanks denise! 

best,
mohammad and elham

204741,3373856,2013-01-19,4103272,Husam,"i absolutely loved my stay at denise's place. her place, to start with, is very clean and cozy, the room was very tidy and organized & the bathroom was spotless. she has lots of sovenieurs and collectables from all over the world, i enjoyed that !! she has traveled alot and lived abroad, which totally shows in her personality for being very open-minded and spontaneous.

i had a job interview in dc and wasn't entheusiastic about taking public transportation there wearing a suit, denise offered me a ride to the interview, besides ones from and to the airport!! i was overwhelmed by her kindness as any other host would probably have just thrown a cab service number at me !!

amazing room, amaing host, great value ... would love to stay there again if ever in dc.

204741,3400714,2013-01-23,4303679,Alicia,"enjoyed our trip to dc.  denise picked us up from the airport and explained how to us public transit.  she showed us the bus route and the metro station.  the only complaint i have was the water did not get very hot, so our showers were a bit cold.  overall, good trip to dc."
204741,3523539,2013-02-11,5017770,Altana,it was really nice stay at the denise place. we are enjoyed conversation. also she  did pick up from center of the city. and her assistant drove us to train station. i really really recommend it.  price location and room all very good) thank you so much) 
204741,3663126,2013-03-01,3599189,Cathy,i stayed with denise while attending a conference. she was very helpful in making sure i could get where i needed to go. a fantastic host!
204741,3714974,2013-03-07,1257514,Ivy,"you will not be regret  choosing this place!  denise's home is so so sweet and clean! the room we stayed was very comfortable! and her cat creamy puff is so adorable! the mta card she borrowed us was very helpful. her assistant glen even picked us up at the union station when we arrived at dc. one thing need to be reminded is the latest bus at night to her home is 8:10pm, so if you want to enjoy a dinner or something else in the city, the time need be arranged well. to sum it up, we had a great experience in dc with denise! "
204741,3740402,2013-03-10,5147906,Mateusz,"i've stayed in denise's place with my girlfriend, we enjoyed it very much. denise picked us up, although we supported her with the information about our arrival time pretty late, because of the tight schedule. denise is a very nice person, very helpful and concrete. she helped us a lot supporting us with the information and brochures about dc, and giving us a lift downtown. the communication in dc is pretty good, the mta cards were very useful and practical. laminated map, which was lended to us had the most important information and very comfortable format. the bed was very comfortable as well. at the checkout denise gave us a ride to the union station, which was a nice way to say goodbye. we enjoyed the stay very much and won't hesitate to choose this offer again in the future. thanks denise!"
204741,3855355,2013-03-21,5198261,Casey,"denise is a great and attentive host.  she was around for the first few days and made sure we knew that we could make ourselves at home.  she offered to drive us to the grocery, and the breakfast and company were wonderful!  she is a unique person."
204741,3959203,2013-03-31,1331893,Kristen,"i had an overall great experience with denise's place.  i only had a brief encounter with her because 1 - i was always out exploring and 2 - she was gone for the most of my stay. however, my encounter with her was excellent. she was really nice and accommodating.  her assistant glen was also very pleasant and helpful. it was great he would pick me up and for a minimal fee bring me to the airport very early in the morning.  her place was nice and comfortable, especially the bed.  i loved that there was a t.v. in my room.  her cat also a sweetie and i am not a cat person so that is saying a lot lol.  unfortunately, her place is not right by a metro but she is right by a bus stop that takes you there and into downtown and her neighborhood felt safe walking through even at night which is important.  she was great with contacting me and making sure i was well taken care of.  i would recommend anyone to stay here.  i would return to her place if i come back to d.c.  thanks for everything denise."
204741,4134671,2013-04-13,5016491,Dmitry,"denise was really nice woman. her assistant glen picked me up from airport and then drove to downtown and denise drove me to metro station when i leave dc, that helps me a lot. it was very convenient that she provides me wmata smarttrip card. place is near many shuttle bus stations that makes access to metro rail stations fast at any time. it is very important that the place is safe. room was comfortable and clean. i recommend this place to anyone who search quiet non-overpriced place in dc. thank you denise."
204741,4421402,2013-05-04,5961263,Mark,"denise's place can be described accurately as ""cozy."" but everything necessary was there....the cable tv in my room had only about eight channels, but it had the basics. the part of town is my only quibble, but once you know (1) the bus schedule; (2) that being out at night isn't advisable in that particular neighborhood; and (3) the directions so the cabbies are confident (use mapquest judiciously), it's just fine. the price was right, so as usual, life has its tradeoffs. it's quiet there, too, so i could sleep easily. great to have the metro card provided as well as useful maps!"
204741,4445926,2013-05-06,5042420,Garry,"denise organised my smooth check-in through her colleague, glen. the bedroom is beautifully furnished; the bed very comfortable and the features exactly as described. very quiet neighbourhood. easy weekday access to nearby bustops and subsequent transfers to metro system. denise responded very promptly to queries and requests. thank you!"
204741,4604806,2013-05-14,6214165,Amy,"suburbia is definitely the best value near down town. i loved how close it is located to the metro bus stop and how quiet the room is at night. denise has her home decorated in an international interest and is very good at utilizing her living space. i enjoyed browsing her collections and yet felt very much at home with her hospitality and the help of her assistant, glenn. it was also nice to have the internet available. thank you so much for a great dc trip!"
204741,4632991,2013-05-17,2767584,Anne,"denise had organised glen to be there to greet me,  he was very helpful explaining the ways to get around.  the metro cards and maps were a great help and did make my first day experience so easy.  the distance to the centres is close, but i will however warn anyone if you need to call a cab, try and prebook.  i tried for over 90 mins, thinking that 2 hours would be enough to get to the station, check in with time for a coffee, the only reason i caught my train was that it  was delayed for 10 mins.  i was told not many cabs are required in that area."
204741,4693822,2013-05-20,6291419,Anna,"thank you, denise!!! we enjoyed the stay. the room was neat,  clean and filled with the spirit of traveling. bed was super soft and comfy. grand merci for the city map and metro- cards!!! bus stop is conveniently located nearby. thanks again!!!! ;)"
204741,4819541,2013-05-27,4950834,Charlotte,"the room and the bed were comfy and neat and the condo is close to the downtown of washington d.c. it was a very good place to be, however the neighborhood is not very lively (no bars, restaurants and groceries).
we would like to emphasize that the communication with denise wasn't good at all. she didn't bother to answer our questions on the neighborhood, saying it is written on her airbnb profile. she didn't either interest a lot in us.
we didn't heard about the ""self-serve breakfast"", so we had to buy ours.
in a nutshell, we didn't find the spirit of airbnb."
204741,4922082,2013-06-02,6095499,Marshall,"i stayed with denise for a week and really enjoyed myself. while i didn't spend a lot of time talking with her or hanging around at her place, she was a welcoming host and it was a pleasure to be there.  her place offers a very comfortable bed and the well decorated and furnished rooms which helped me to feeling very relaxed while there. her place is definitely not within any sort of walking distance to downtown dc but it doesn't take much to figure out the convenient bus and subway systems nearby. a day stay or a week-long vaca, i highly recommend staying with denise."
204741,5032499,2013-06-09,3263657,Jonathan & Yajaira,"denise was a generous and helpful host. with no doubt, we highly recommend her as a place to stay if visiting washington!!"
204741,5485418,2013-07-02,6034239,Nicholas,"denise and pete were great people. i felt very comfortable there my entire 2 week stay. not only they are extremely nice, but also the apartment is very cozy and enjoyable to live in. i felt at home.
denise let me have my girlfriend, mona, stay there the last 2 nights and was very welcoming to her.

ps- the cat, creamy, is adorable. "
204741,5719118,2013-07-13,7165790,Linda,"this was my first experience with airbnb.  it was a fun adventure and a great value in comparison to other options.  the bedroom was very comfortable and it was quiet.  we slept well and enjoyed our stay.  creampuff kitty is so sweet and pretty; we ""talked"" to each other and i enjoyed petting him. we appreciated the use of the metro cards!"
204741,5910690,2013-07-22,6701605,Viktor,"our stay here was a great pleasure, denise is very welcoming host, she helps us to understand the metro and the bus in washington dc as well as parking for my car. the neighborhood is black but safe, we had no problem even to come back walking in the dark. the washer and dryer is available but you have to pay 3$ for each.  there is enough of place for free parking on the street close to building."
204741,6692683,2013-08-21,2296158,Emmanuel,"i didn't seedenise. but i experienced annd lived her spirit. positive. from the outset, she specifies rules on her doormat. destabilizing ? no, reassuring if we like the order. and i like the order. her house is welcoming. everything is clean, and appropriate and settled well. bonus: glenn, her friend. he is never far away. as an angel-guard, he always takes you out of a possible critical situation. i recommend this apartment to all.
thank u denise."
204741,6742313,2013-08-23,3081257,Qi,the room is clean. the bed is so comfortable. we enjoyed our sleep and breakfasts at her place. she also prepared sweet gifts for guests.
204741,6830174,2013-08-26,8168048,Bob,"denise's assistant, glen, picked me up at ronald regan airport ($15). he was very personable and helpful during my two day stay. due to a conflict he was unable to drive me back to the airport for my return flight. however, it was very convenient to take a bus (two blocks to the bus stop on the weekend) and ~15 minutes later i was at the metro and within 30 minutes i was at the ronald regan airport metro station.

denise was out of state during my visit so i had the run of the house. the bedroom had plenty of storage for clothes was quiet the bed was very comfortable. the kitchen is well equipped. there was plenty of coffee and instant oatmeal for breakfast.

overall, i was very satisfied with my stay."
204741,6885530,2013-08-28,6970619,Lei,"glen is very kind guy. the condo is nice, near a subway station and parking is convenience. the maps and metro cards they offered are very useful. good choice."
204741,6935737,2013-08-31,6697319,Lennart,"we were on a vacation. in washington we stayed at denise house. denise and her assistant glenn are very kind and helpful. it only takes round about 30min to be in washington central. we had a nice stay in washington, thanks again!"
204741,7039085,2013-09-04,6956788,Aurelie,"perfect! quartier tranquil, calme- appartement propre, belle chambre- denise n'était pas là, mais nous avons rencontré glen son assistant- très sympa-
l'appartement est certes un peu loin de toutes commodités, mais les transports public sont juste à coté-
je recommande vivement cet appartement-
pour une premiere experience airbnb, tres content- 
"
204741,7247820,2013-09-13,7685391,Aleksejs,"great place in overall. room is very clean and comfy. i don't like to have a bunch of mirrors in my bedroom, but this is trifle.. commuting might be the main issue, but if you are right on time at the bus stop, you'll get to the downtown in about 50 min. just stick to the bus schedule. neighborhood is fine - not upper class environment, you'll meet a lot of funny folks in the metro/bus stop after midnight, but these are friendly and unharmful folks, who won't bother you without a reason. but above all is the incredible price!!! perfect for low-budget travelers!!!"
204741,7512691,2013-09-23,7977361,Melody,"this was my first airbnb experience and it wasn't bad at all. denise made me feel welcome and made my 4 day stay pleasant. the metro was easy to use and convenient. if you get a chance, get off at the gallery/china town station and enjoy downtown dc; there is good food and shopping and once you are done the green line will take you back to denis's. once you are back at the condo, you can relax on that wonderful mattress:)

thank you denise for offering to pick me up when it was raining!"
204741,7758822,2013-10-01,8943891,Kc,"i did not enjoy my stay at ""suburbia in the city"". the location was not ideal for those who are visiting dc, there is no public transportation near, riding in a cab is a necessity and very costly ($60 a day). every cab driver and locals i spoke with told me that the neighborhood i was in was very dangerous and to carry pepper spray at all times. me and the other 2 who stayed had to run into the house everyday, because there were fights in the streets and people yelling and cursing at each other (right outside our door!) 
the host did not notify me what time she wanted us to check out, she then harassed me by calling me numerous times and when i did speak to her she was unnecessary mean spirited to me. she demanded that we pay her more money for staying later into the day, even though she never gave us a check out time. airbnb is not a hotel service, times vary, i've had another experience where check out time was at 6pm. we did not stay pass sept. 30th and thus did not pay her.
i absolutely regret my stay, i do not recommend anyone to rent out the room. i was scared to even step outside the apt; thus paying $60 a day for a cab to be out of the neighborhood as much as possible. and the owner made me feel awful, something a paying customer should not have to experience."
204741,7892513,2013-10-07,8880630,Jean,the house was great with a nice kitchen. and assist glen was very nice and helpful. and you have to notice that there is no bus service  from house to mrt on weekend.
204741,7947340,2013-10-09,6107762,Chris,"my stay was very nice, even though the government was shutdown and most everything was closed.  the room was great very comfortable.  she had smart cards to use and all kinds of maps and infromation to make it easy."
204741,8055951,2013-10-14,7990450,Zoe,"it was very comfortable staying at denise's, the bed was extremely comfortable and her assistant glen was very helpful. would definitely recommend."
204741,8173582,2013-10-19,2948141,Shyam,very comfortable. would stay again
204741,8286793,2013-10-23,8993721,Cédric,"superbe appartement confortable et chaleureux.
nous avons pas vu denise pendant notre séjour mais tous c'est bien passer avec son assistant glen qui nous a même récupère les bagage pour évité de les avoir avec nous dans les transport en commun la journée!
loin de washington 35 min a pied jusqu'à la station de métro ou 20min en bus puis 30min de métro pour arrivée au centre de washington.
mal desservit en bus le weekend."
204741,8441049,2013-10-31,5043873,Aurelie,"le logement, propre et fonctionnel, correspond bien à l'annonce. de plus il est bien desservi par des bus tant en semaine que le week-end qui permettent ensuite de récupérer aisément le métro. il faut compter environ 40 minutes pour arriver au mall. glen est vraiment très sympa et se montre disponible si l'on a la moindre question. dommage que denise ai été en déplacement à ce moment là."
204741,8521578,2013-11-04,8730598,Elizabeth,"this is a great value for frugal travelers who are comfortable taking public transportation and interacting with locals. being white, i stuck out a bit in this predominately african american community, but people were helpful and kind, steering me to the right bus stop, etc. denise provided maps and a metro pass and it wasn't hard to find my way."
204741,8770299,2013-11-17,9635395,Nathaniel,"suburbia in the city is a delightfully cozy and enjoyable experience. the condo is clean, and the room has everything one might need. we were especially pleased with the location, as it was an easy drive to everywhere we wanted to go. we had a lovely weekend, and enjoyed it immensely. "
204741,9182966,2013-12-11,9976910,Fabrice,"denise has been a very good host !
she was there for help us ! she is very close of bus station and train ( very pratical weekdays&weekend ) .denise is real host with bed&breakfast . 
we recommend it !!!!! "
204741,9461467,2013-12-30,3086621,Aishani,"absolutely would recommend this room to anyone. denise was a very gracious host, she drove us to the station when we were leaving because she happened to be free and she lent us umbrellas when it was forecast to rain.

we mostly were sightseeing so we didn't spend a whole lot of time in the apartment, and as a result of this, there was no scheduling conflict when it came to using the bathroom.

the neighbourhood was full of lovely, friendly and helpful people. they were absolutely delightful. everybody was so kind, even when the weather was rotten.

if you're interested in staying somewhere where you can be independent from your host, then this place is ideal. of you don't like public transport then you might be better off with a hire car, but only because you have to catch a bus to get to the train station and if its cold, you don't want to be spending 45ish minutes getting to a location that is only a 15 minute drive away.

anyway, i loved my time here and the next time i am in dc i'll be staying with denise again!!!"
205809,521582,2011-09-11,1002132,Claudia,"a group of us went to dc to advocate for safer alternatives to harmful flea & tick products. our trip was paid for by individuals and we met with the epa, politicians and did one on one outreach. we looked into airbnb by the recommendation of a friend as an alternative to have a home base for up to 8 people. this has been a fantastic experience for us. elizabeth rocks & the house was perfectly located for us and saved us much money over a hotel.

elizabeth was wonderful as a hostess and the house was fantastic. it saved us much money with so much more space then staying in a hotel. the home is clean and has a great ""homey"" feeling.  elizabeth was in contact via phone with whatever we needed - even for silly questions like where the nearest late night grocery store was. she worked with us every step of the way and i can't say enough."
205809,636929,2011-10-17,872137,David,"elizabeth's home is wonderful ... i can't recommend it highly enough!  it has the character you would expect in a home built years ago but with all the modern conveniences and fresh look due to an extensive renovation.  the beds are so incredibly comfortable that after our first night i let elizabeth know we would be leaving a little later than planned on our last day because we would want to sleep in later!!  it is very roomy and is in a great, safe location, just a mile from ft. trotten metro station (which has parking) and just a couple of miles from catholic university of america.  "
205809,647369,2011-10-20,1112456,Darnell,"we loved staying here!  my family and i drove up from fl.  elizabeth was quick to help guide us on routes via the metro etc.  it was a unique way to experience d.c.  the house was clean, charming and inviting.  we would stay here again.  "
205809,750768,2011-11-28,550581,Remi,"the house was wonderful!  elizabeth and brian provided detailed information about the house and the neighboring area so we could find all the conveniences we needed, and it was so nice to stay in a place that really felt like a home away from home rather than just a small and stuffy hotel room.  i will definitely look for availability at their house for my next trip to d.c.!"
205809,1339444,2012-05-24,1805094,Mark,"we had an enjoyable trip to dc for business and this was the perfect place to stay. the house is clean, spacious, updated and accessible with numerous modes of transport within close proximity. the owners are very accommodating to needs. there was no problematic issues during our stay. definitely a 5-star rating and good value."
223922,566890,2011-09-25,1162978,Jay,"our stay at this property was simply wonderful. natasha was lovely. considerate and welcoming and really went the extra mile to make sure we were ok.
the apartment is gorgeous and cosy with simply everything that one would need. its a stones throw from the beautiful rock creek park, and the whole area is beautiful. 
we couldnt have chosen a better place to stay, we were thoroughly impressed, and thouroughly enjoyed our visit.
we definately recommend this property. :)"
223922,590863,2011-10-02,166629,Ken And Lizzie,"natasha's apartment is very nice and completely private. full kitchen, cable tv, and wifi. and a nice pool table. only a couple blocks from the beautiful rock creek park - which we biked to often. (washington is now one of america's most bike-friendly cities - many nice off-road trails and on-street bike lanes, plus the new capital bikeshare inexpensive rental bikes). also, natasha was very flexible about our check out when we have car trouble and had to delay our departure from dc. thanks again, natasha!"
223922,604583,2011-10-06,1199593,Jane,natasha was the perfect hostess!  her apartment is exactly as described and the pictures are true. one day she even brought us to the metro and picked us up later!  our first morning we awoke  to deer grazing on the front lawn.  very close to downtown and conn. ave. where there are lots of ethnic restaurants. we felt extremely safe at all times. a perfect place for a visit to dc! thank you natasha!
223922,645455,2011-10-19,1028874,Angie,the apartment was very nice.  natasha is a great host.  a car is recommended to get around from the apartment.  natasha does provide a shuttle service to the metro.  i would recommend this to anyone who is coming to dc that doesn't mind driving.
223922,664034,2011-10-25,1268360,Randye,perfect place for the 2 of us. wish we could have spent more time there. natasha was very lovely eve though i was very late after getting stuck in rush hour traffic trying to get there from up north.
223922,716938,2011-11-14,1299632,Carmen,the apartment was lovely and extremely comfortable. natasha was very helpful and easily accessible. i had a great time. 
223922,791346,2011-12-18,1431423,Janaka,i organized a surprised birthday party at natasha's place and it went smoothly as i planned. she was a very helpful host and even came down to take some pictures of the party. highly recommended. 
223922,800806,2011-12-22,1515617,Jarret,"amazing!  the apartment is incredibly spacious, well-furnished, cozy, and charming.  i used it as a welcome-home from abroad gift for my girlfriend, and she loved it!  natasha was very flexible and helping in lending all the kitchen utensils i needed to cook dinner.  best kept secret in dc is right - great value and great experience."
223922,820628,2012-01-01,1474736,Curtis,natasha goes the extra mile to ensure that her guests are comfortable and contented..she is an excellent host!
223922,1040084,2012-03-25,1766437,Amanda,natasha was really nice and  an amazing host. the apartment is really cute and its a 10 minute walk from a bus stop so you can get to downtown really easy. also the park behind the house is really pretty and a nice place to walk.
223922,1055460,2012-03-28,1816403,Solenne,"natasha was very helpful and accommodating. the space was clean and it was in a peaceful neighborhood.( a note for people on the sprint network, we needed to step outside to get data.)"
223922,1095066,2012-04-07,2027354,Kacey,natasha is a fantastic hostess!  the photos are true (except we didn't see any of the deer.)  the apartment is cozy and well apportioned.  it is situated in a beautifully sylvan area that makes you forget that you're anywhere near a city.  the only drawback is that the metro station is quite a hike from her house.
223922,1105432,2012-04-10,713403,Molly,"natasha was so pleasant, and the setting of her house is spectacular. you forget you're in the city. we have a hard time finding places to stay with our dog, but natasha was wonderful and allowed us to stay! she gave me a ride to the metro when i first arrived. definitely recommend staying here, the apartment is great!"
223922,1132226,2012-04-15,398637,Stacie,"thank you so much for a wonderful stay! we had everything we needed and the flat was lovely. if we had any question they were quickly answered and contact was easy. it was an amazing area to explore and how close to everything you were but still felt away from the hustle. thank you again for a wonderful stay.

223922,1200887,2012-04-30,361627,Mark,natasha’s apartment was clean and tastefully decorated. the kitchen and bathroom were spotless. snacks and bottled water were provided.  natasha provided a warm welcome and explained how to use the wi-fi.  she kindly offered assistance in navigating washington dc.  my only regret was that i could not spend more time enjoying the tranquility and the scenic views from the apartment which was minutes by car to the site of my business meetings.  highly recommended.  i would gladly stay there again when in washington dc
223922,1225624,2012-05-04,1902246,Irina,"we liked the apartment, it's exactly like described in the pictures. the house is situated in a nice quiet area but it's easy to get to downtown by bus. natasha was very friendly and helped us a lot. would definitely recommend this apartment."
223922,1283942,2012-05-15,196498,Cheryl,"natasha provides a roomy, very clean one bedroom apartment. we did not use the additional entertainment area but the pictures show it well. the location is convenient and beautiful so close to rock creek park.  the availability of parking that does not require a permit is a real plus for visitors with a rental car. the extra touches such as snacks and use of the washer dryer are very nice. because of the steps to your apartment we would suggest that you tuck a flashlight into your bag if you'll be coming in and out at night "
223922,1299679,2012-05-18,2212370,Joseph,the apartment is cozy and in a great location. 
223922,1325947,2012-05-22,490424,Vicki,"we had a wonderful trip and want to thank natasha for being a good hostess.  we did not arrive till almost 11pm and she stayed up to welcome us to her ""private retreat"".   i would love to stay there again if she'll have us.  i would encourage you to have a car to get around.  this wonderful little retreat is out of the way, meaning in a nice woodsy quite area, there isn't anything close by that you wan walk to.  natasha provides you with your own parking space - which makes having a car easy. 
thank you natasha for inviting us to your home. we hope to stay again in the future.

223922,1435061,2012-06-07,2522180,Alessandro,"a big thank you to natasha for hosting us! she was very nice, friednly and made everything possible to make our short stay in washington dc a magic moment. 
she kindly came to pick us up (and drove us back) at the metro station near her house.
she provided us with two bicycles which turned out to be the best way to visit dc in such short time :-)
she gave us all information we needed to visit the city.
also the nice small flat she provided to us had everything we needed! very comfortable and well equipped.
the only thing is that we where a bit far from the centre, for the rest all was excellent!
we recommend !"
223922,1473259,2012-06-13,2171538,Ed,"this apt. is well appointed!  if you have your own transportation it would be fabulous!  the walk from the bus line is 10 min, in a very safe neighborhood.  the zoo is nearby.  natasha is very gracious in offering assistance!"
223922,1531370,2012-06-21,2555332,Stephanie,"we had such a wonderful stay with natasha! the apartment was very nice and comfortable. being right near rock creek park we saw lots of wildlife, deer wandering about! we were able to drive about a half mile to free on street parking a mere 2 blocks from the van ness metro station. we had a great trip and natasha was a wonderful host. i highly recommend to anyone who is considering staying."
223922,1593019,2012-06-30,1991125,Julie,"this place is exactly what the pictures show.  natasha is a wonderful host and provides a safe living space.  she gave advice when asked and has bikes for you to ride if you wish.  

i was concerned about safety in the city.  this place is in a great neighborhood and we felt safe while staying here.  

thanks natasha for providing a great place to stay in dc.
"
223922,1689745,2012-07-12,1907621,Jerry,"well, we picked the week of the terrible storm to be in dc, power outages everywhere, we had no ac for 2 days with temps over 100. but natasha did a great job of recovering. the place was perfect for our needs; we used the ""playroom"" to watch the 4th of july telecast with family that lives in dc, things that we wanted to do were close by, and access to downtown was also easy."
223922,1731494,2012-07-17,2557734,Lois,"lovely and quiet, this basement apartment is a wonderful urban retreat.  close the door to the basement rec room, and you've got a 1 bdrm efficiency apartment to be private in.  open the rec room door and you've got space to entertain 30 or more.

the beds were comfy and the kitchen was more than adequate.  

we'll definitely keep this in mind for our next stay in washington dc!"
223922,1751235,2012-07-19,2954130,Yuriy,natasha was very friendly and kindly offered me a ride from the train stop to her place. the apartment was very neat and clean. i enjoyed my stay at natasha's. 
223922,1763343,2012-07-21,2309327,Bernard,"accueil parfait: logement parfait qui correspond exactement à la description. notre séjour sera inoubliable- si nous retournons à washington d.c. nous saurons où loger! merci à natasha.

le grand plan de la ville affichée dans la chambre a été d'une très grande aide.
"
223922,1804131,2012-07-26,116126,Vicki,"natasha's place was perfect - i only wish i could have stayed longer (i was only there three nights).  the apartment is very cozy, was very clean, and had many very nice little touches like snacks and beverages, maps of the area, closet space, ironing board/iron.  the adjoining rec room was perfect for the evening i had friends over - we spread out and felt right at home.  
natasha greeted me and helped me settle in, and was available if i needed anything.  her place is beautiful, in a quiet and lovely part of town.  it was the ideal place to return to after a busy day of visiting relatives, seeing museums, and being overwhelmed by the wonderful restaurant choices in d.c.  it was helpfully close to the columbia heights neighborhood i was visiting.  
it might be difficult to get around from natasha's  without a car or bicycle as there is not a close metro station.  that's the only potential drawback!  thank you natasha for a lovely stay!

"
223922,1944736,2012-08-10,1390386,Jared,natasha gave us a warm welcome.her place was very comfortable with many ammenities.we look forward to staying there again.
223922,2130489,2012-08-28,1785169,Paul,top quality!  great location and completely hassle free.  
223922,2152202,2012-08-31,3173589,Burton,"the apartment was very nice, and the location was excellent. natasha spivack was very accomodating. i would definitely recommend this apartment!!"
223922,2242565,2012-09-09,3404501,Debbie,"natasha's basement apt was a good place to stay, nestled in the woods just yards from trails into rock creek park.  our host could not have been more welcoming or helpful.  she responded immediately to anything we needed.  be prepared for some overhead noise and basement lighting and odors, but the setting and their hospitality made it a great stay."
223922,2271230,2012-09-12,9355304,Richard,"natasha's description of her place is accurate but understates how nice the place is-- it's great!  and even better if you like walking, as the walk through rock creek park to the metro is really beautiful.  (if you don't have a smart phone, try to obtain or download the nps map beforehand, as the trail system can be a bit confusing without one).  at night, the bus along 16th street would be a better choice, as the park trails to the metro truly are country paths; the walk from the bus to her place is short and through a very pretty neighborhood.  you can also walk down rock creek all the way to the potomac and the mall, if you like.

the only downside of staying at natasha's is that the place is an ""attractive nuisance""-- it and the surrounding area is so nice that you might never want to leave to go downtown!"
223922,2297112,2012-09-15,9355304,Richard,"as i originally booked 9/11-9/14 and subsequently added 9/10 to my booking,  airbnb has sent me another review request.  so i will add to what i've already said that, aside from providing us a really great place to stay, natasha was also very helpful and accommodating to our needs.

great place, great location, great host--what else could you want?

just don't book when we want to return!

p.s. for you technologically challenged hiking aficionados, i left a bunch of rock creek park maps in the apartment, so you're all set.  enjoy!"
223922,2344033,2012-09-19,1138453,Francois,we spent a wonderful time in the natasha apartment. everything was great and natasha was really warmful! i strongly recommended this apartment. 
223922,2437711,2012-09-28,3413473,Helfried,many thanks for picking us up at the van ness bus stop. also we have to say thank you for making the reservation of the shuttle bus to the airport next morning.
223922,2492753,2012-10-03,998959,Mark,"we stayed at natasha's basement apartment for 4 days and found it to be clean, tidy and well equipped for our stay.

the apartment has a cooker, fridge freezer, tv, private bathroom and is a good size for a short stay. next to the private apartment is a lounge area with a pool table and a big screen tv along with the laundry facilities which came in very handy for our stay. there's also 2 car parking spots which is handy 

natasha was very friendly and welcoming and offered some tips on visiting the city.  there's a big city map in the bedroom - which reminds me, the bed is very comfortable.

natasha was also very kind enough to invite us to a party she was holding above us, however as we were tired from the day's sightseeing we decided to give it a miss.

the neighbourhood is very nice and clean and is a short walk away from 16th street where the s2/s4 bus stops - catch one of these buses to get to the main area of washington dc - the federal triangle. here you'll be able to walk and see the white house, vietnam war memorial/reflecting pool and all the other main sights of the city.

overall, we'd recommend this accommodation and would gladly stay again if we ever return to washington dc.

223922,2520560,2012-10-06,3368627,Sandra,"we really enjoyed our stay at natasha's. she's very friendly and made us feel welcome immediately. also, she picked us up at the station and drove us to the station on other occasions too- an extraordinary service! if we were to visit dc again we'd stay here."
223922,2590436,2012-10-12,3686652,Barb,"thank you natasha for a very pleasant stay. this is a delightful completely self contained apartment in a beautiful residential area, very close to extensive parkland. within reasonable walking distance t.o a city bus."
223922,2749821,2012-10-29,3569979,Yana,"excelent, convinient located place. very quiet and clean. friendly atmosphere! would highly recommend "
223922,2875596,2012-11-13,3427952,Paul,"very nice place.  my brother, his wife, and i stayed 5 days and were all involved with veteran's day.  natasha was very friendly and helpful.  close to public transportation (a short steep hill on the way) in a very nice neighborhood. i liked that we were able to get away from the hustle and bustle of the big city at night and really unwind and de-stress a little.
the game room is huge with a large tv."
223922,3858593,2013-03-21,2225267,David,great hostess and wonderful hospitality. natasha so graciously drove me to and from the metro station a few times which was most helpful.
223922,5399371,2013-06-28,4113456,Nick,"we had a great stay at natasha's basement apartment, using it as home base to explore the dc area. natasha was very welcoming and gracious, giving us lots of tips on how to best navigate the metro and bus system (which we promptly forgot and had to learn ourselves the hard way, c'est la vie). while there we saw a baby deer in her front yard. we loved the giant game room, watched a couple movies on the big screen television, and played board games. and the washer/dryer combo is excellent and convenient. my only concern, and one i should have checked on, is that when the bed is pulled out from the couch, nobody gets by to the bathroom. my kids laughed and hummed the mission impossible theme as i crawled across their feet on my way to brush my teeth. but all in all we had a terrific time and would not hesitate to return. "
223922,5465209,2013-07-01,6742151,Annita,"we enjoyed our stay at natasha's.  the accommodations were comfortable and relaxing.  we especially liked the kitchen, so we could fix our own breakfasts and snacks.  the washer and dryer were handy, too. 
there was a large map on the wall and natasha showed us how to get around, which was very helpful.   we would definitely recommend it to friends."
223922,5608663,2013-07-08,1221452,Mj,"natasha's private apartment space was fantastic and matched the description she had listed.  the space is really big i would say around 1000 square feet.  there are 2 bathrooms, 2 living rooms and great sleeping accommodations.  natasha was lovely she was very prompt with answers to all of my questions and extremely nice and helpful in suggesting several great routes and activities when travelling to historic sites.  she is a 10 minute drive (4 miles) to downtown dc and very close to good shopping and restaurants.  her place was very homey and nice to come back to after a long day. 

i highly recommend staying here especially when it comes to parking - most hotels in dc charge their guests $20-$30/day for parking and it is nice to park your car in a driveway located in a safe neighborhood when you are away (for free)!"
223922,5799975,2013-07-16,7387393,Mike,"location, location,location. right off the park route of beach drive which funnels you out at the kennedy centre. you are at the mall in under 15 minutes. apartment comes with washer/dryer(shared) and is near the cleveland park--forest lawn neighbourhoods.
natasha is helpful and eager to please. we would stay here on our next visit to dc."
223922,5834060,2013-07-18,63375,Kevin,natasha was warm and friendly.  she drove us to the subway twice durring our stay there and was helpful in explaining the area on the map on the wall in our room. i also saw 2 deer from her front yard in broad daylight.  i really enjoyed walking the trails by her house. if i had to do it again i'd print out a map of the trails because at&t ( (hidden by airbnb) maps) did not work in the valley of the park. i was traveling with my son this time and he enjoyed playing pool and the snacks that natasha left out for us.
223922,5872378,2013-07-20,7301285,Olga,"прекрасный отдых! наташа подробно рассказала нам о всех интересных местах города,дала полезные советы.нам все очень понравилось, у нас была отдельная квартирка с индивидуальной дверью, спокойно и тихо. наташа жизнерадостный человек и отличная хозяйка!"
223922,5908391,2013-07-22,6458311,Ariel,"our stay was quite memorable. having one's own parking spot was nice! and the hostess was quite friendly.

the location was quite accessible to a nearby metro, in which finding a parking space was not difficult and free! from there it was quite easy to get to the d.c. mall.

we didn't get to use much of the other amenities, such as the pool table and large screen tv, since we left early morning and returned in the evening, and quite tired by then. but for those who like billiards ... play on.

in christ,

ariel and tabitha"
223922,6282588,2013-08-06,4943916,Kavita,"natasha was very nice, and we had a very pleasant stay. the apartment was clean and very spacious. also, the pool table in the basement was a huge plus!"
223922,6612055,2013-08-19,955692,Katherine,"this was a very welcome retreat at the end of long days of sightseeing in dc.  quiet neighbourhood near rock creek park, everything was as advertised. we weren't there enough to take advantage of the games room, but really enjoyed staying here. we didn't see too much of natasha, but knew she was there if needed. would definitely stay here again."
223922,6701622,2013-08-21,4855190,Kevin,"the location is lovely and and very peaceful. in the end we didn't spend much time at the apartment because we were out seeing the sights. natasha was very enthusiastic about explaining the ways of getting to the city and friendly and helpful in general. 

our only problem was that it was a bit warm and stuffy at night because there's no a/c and the windows didn't have mesh to keep the bugs out. apparently the mesh was removed for cleaning and will be replaced. there was a fan provided. 

we really appreciated the off-street parking and the easy access to public transport. "
223922,7142534,2013-09-08,3920575,Elena,"мы с мужем провели  незабываемую неделю отдыха у наташи в
доме.наташа чудесная хозяйка, с которой общаться одно удовольствие.за время отдыха мы очень сблизились и отмечали  совместные дни рождения с ее семьей. мы жили в апартаментах с отдельным входом, что делало нас независимыми. они оформлены с большим вкусом и у нас создавалось впечатление, что мы жили дома. место, где расположен дом я бы назвала сказочным, поскольку он расположен в 7 км. от белого дома и в лесу одновременно. по территории бегают белки и приходят в гости олени целыми семьями, мы лично видели .очень высокие рекомендации для будущих гостей, которые хотят посмотреть вашингтон и жить в сказке одновременно.большое спасибо наташе и ее семье. отдельный привет четвероногому другу гоше."
223922,7314222,2013-09-15,7168805,Dominik,"natashas place was very neat and cozy! the location is perfect if you're travelling by car and need a parking spot. the next metro station is just a few car-minutes away and if you're tired of driving, you can take the bus just a few blocks away. both methods are taking you directly into the heart of washington in just a few minutes!
although it was so centrally located, we did see some deers right outside of our door! 
if you're tired of being in your private area, you can just open the door to the game room and shoot some billard or watch tv on a big screen. unfortunately we didn't had time to do this but it's on our plan for our next visit. 
natasha was also always available if we had any questions and gave us helpful tips on our arrival. 

we're definitely staying there the next time we visit washington. "
223922,7592280,2013-09-25,5297940,Helga,"we stayed for 3 nights in natasha's apartment. the day we came the deer stood for the house. we were so surprised that we took immediately a photo of them. the apartment was very nice, clean and private and natasha is very kind. thank you we had a great time."
223922,7731271,2013-09-30,9088252,Gerard,natasha is a nice host and nice person.she took time to show me a map of the d.c. and explained some of the different streets.the apartment was very clean and modern.i would stay there again and would recommend this to a friend.
223922,7765183,2013-10-01,3345639,Hans,"natasha took great care of us. the location is one of the best in dc unless you have to be downtown. only 3 miles from the white house. the unit is well functioning and there is free private parking.
highly recommended and certainly well worth the price!

223922,7957369,2013-10-09,137920,Konstantin,"natasha was very nice and hospitable. the apartment had everything we needed and even more. it was pouring outside and natasha offered us her umbrella which we forgot to return. it was too late when i realized that, but i hope we will be forgiven. i'd definitely recommend natasha's place to anyone looking for a quite, comfortable and inexpensive hideout in dc. thank you natasha!"
223922,8087798,2013-10-15,2899730,Елена,natasha is a great host! she is very nice and friendly! she has helped us and answered all our questions. the apartment is wonderful and clean! highly recommended as a host.
223922,8148078,2013-10-18,383782,Johan + Jennifer,it was great staying with natasha. she provided us with bus/metro cards and explained which areas to visist and which busses to take. we enjoyed the beatiful neighbourhood. highly recommended 
223922,8360366,2013-10-27,9524675,Ramona,"we stayed two nights at nataschas home. this small apartment is an awesome place to stay for a couple of days or even longer. it is in an perfect location if you like being close to the center but to feeling as if you are staying in a green, calm, friendly area.
public transport is just around the corner.
the flat itself has everything you need and even more. it is cared for in a lovely way. me and my boyfriend also enjoyed the pool table and the nice tv corner.
a big thanks goes to natascha herself. she is a lovely person and cared so much for us explaining everything around and answering all questions we had.
we definetly recommand this awesome place."
223922,8533935,2013-11-04,5789930,Erick,"we had a great stay at natasha's place. it is in a quiet neighborhood in the rock creek park area, which means lots of trees and greenery nearby. it is also quite easy to get to all the sights: easiest is to catch the s2 bus from 16th street (about ~10-15 min walk) which stops a block away from the white house, or right by the farragut north station for transfer to the red line. or walk to the red line's van ness station (about 30 min). for this, we found it easiest to take the soapstone valley trail (you'll find it on (hidden by airbnb) maps) since tilden street is quite a steep climb! in any case, for either option natasha made smartrip (dc metro) cards available on which we could just load some more value. and she provided all the maps and brochures you could ever need! the apartment is ideal for a couple, and has all the necessary amenities. i'd definitely recommend a stay here! "
223922,8722740,2013-11-13,7277568,Johannes,"natasha was a nice host and her apartment was clean, comfortable and convenient. as others have written, the location is not quite so convenient if you have to rely a lot on public transit, but natasha goes out of her way to shuttle you to the metro station whenever she can. also, if you have to go to nih like i did, it's just a 10min metro ride away on the same line ... if you come with some time to enjoy the park, it's definitely great! and yes, one day when i walked out the door, i was greeted by three deer on the front lawn :) "
223922,8835892,2013-11-20,9341813,Tilo,"staying at natasha's place was very nice and convenient, she also went out of her way to make it extra comfortable, picking me up from the metro station and dropping me off at the conference centre the next morning. the house is in a quiet and beautiful area, but not too far away from the city and its sights. i used the bike that natasha provided and it made getting around a lot easier, but public transport is in walkable distance. the apartment is spacious and had everything i needed. i highly recommend staying here for a pleasant dc experience."
223922,8898659,2013-11-25,7242025,Jack,"i stayed for 5 nights while attending a conference in woodley park. the apartment is super clean, very comfortable, roomy and updated. my son, who is interviewing in d.c. stayed with me and we had plenty of room. easy access to both van ness and cleveland park and a nice daytime walk to the woodley park area along rock creek parkway and throug the zoo   while the apartment is centrally located it is a bit logistically challenging if you are on a tight schedule. buses and metros are nearby and easy to walk to. natasha will also give you a ride to to the metro or pick you up if you arrange it with her, she gave me a ride to the conference hotel and showed me where to park around the van ness metro stop my first days in town. the off street parking is great and if you come to d.c. with a car (which i usually try not to do!) natasha's place can't be beat, it's just a 5-10 minute drive to the van nesss metro on the red line which offers plenty of cheap and free parking in the area. buses are a 15 minute walk or so and take you direct to downtown and the white house. the van ness metro is walkable too (about 20-25 minutes, mainly because of the big hill on tildent) but if you are a walker like me, you will just love the location! natasha is a wonderful host and very accommodating. the apartment and amenities are exactly as described. if you are into urban exploration this is a wonderful place from which to explore d.c. by foot, bike and public transit,  as a communication researcher, i would highly recommend natasha's place if you need to spend extended time in d.c. doing field research and visiting archives,  government agencies or institutions.   "
223922,9360685,2013-12-23,4483303,Rachel Sally,"    our stay at natasha's was wonderful. the basement apartment is cute and airy and clean. we slept on the queen bed and my husband said it was a comfy one ( and he is ultra fussy). the kitchenette had a coffee maker and natasha had  ground coffee and some snacks available to get us going in the morning.
     the area close by was full of life. connecticut avenue is lively, full of restaurants and interesting shops.we even went to the movies at the uptown theater which is one of those old fashioned giant ones from the 1940's! however, you really need a car to get there."
262629,710630,2011-11-11,1380836,Suzanne,i arranged this stay for my son who just relocated to dc.  he was very pleased with his accommodations.  ellen was a pleasure to talk to and was very helpful. i was extremely pleased with this entire experience. 
262629,948102,2012-02-26,181217,Sabahat,"i really enjoyed my time here.  ellen could not have been nicer and more helpful.  the room was great.  the distance to metro was a 15-20 minutes walk which i did not find too strenuous.  else there is a bus that stops right outside the house which will take you straight to the metro station.  ellen will help you understand which bus to take but it's not very complicated at all.  overall, i would highly recommend this place to anyone who needed to stay in dc for a conference etc or some other temporary basis."
262629,1040002,2012-03-25,1723249,Brett,ellen was a gracious host and full of ideas of things to do in the dc area.  she is genuinely interested in meeting new people.
262629,1408741,2012-06-04,1509136,Easha,i had a great 2.5 month stay at ellen's place!  it is in a residential area close to the takoma metro line.  it is about a 20 minute walk over; i enjoyed this walk daily to and from work.  the home was very comfortable and convenient.  
262629,1891092,2012-08-05,2493572,Jacob,"great overall experience.  ellen was an excellent hostess (she even made a cake for my birthday) and made sure i was well taken care of during my 3 month stay.  additionally, the house itself is not very far from the red line metro (it took me about 20 minutes to walk there) and is also not far from drugstores, grocery stores, fast food restaurants, etc.   i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for temporary housing while in dc."
262629,2333130,2012-09-18,2923557,Claudio,"""my stay was better than all of my best expectations.  the house is accommodating and well-furnished. the guestroom and bath is clean and comfortable. the neighborhood is enjoyable and within walking distance to the metro station and grocery.  ellen is very polite and helpful, so i strongly recommend. good travels!""

"
262629,2709698,2012-10-24,3852878,Evan,"i really enjoyed my stay with ellen. she was a very nice and extremely helpful host. the place was very nice, comfortable, and quiet. the bed was very comfortable and the room as well as private bath was very clean. pretty much as expected, and more. i definitely would recommend ellen's place for future visitors to the dc area.  "
262629,3496017,2013-02-08,3341579,Kayleigh,"i had a fantastic 3 month stay at ellen's. the house is in a great location, around a 20 minute pleasant walk to takoma metro station, which is located on the red line. there is also a bus that stops right outside ellen's which will take you straight to the metro station- ellen will explain how to use public transport, but its very easy! the house is also near shops, places to eat and the grocery store. the house itself is lovely, comfortable and well-furnished, as is the bedroom and bathroom. ellen is a fantastic host, it was an absolute pleasure to stay in her home and get to know her. she is very nice and made me feel very welcome. she is also extremely helpful and made my stay in dc enjoyable! i highly recommend ellen to anyone looking for temporary accommodation while in dc! "
262629,5018006,2013-06-08,4742130,Kathleen,"ellen hosted me at her place for a little more than 3 months and sharing housing with her was very pleasant thanks to ellen's very welcoming attitude, her sociability and constant kindness, and the fact that she was always very polite, respectful and easy-going. in terms of location and services nearby, the takoma area is a pleasant place to stay and the bus stops very close from the house are convenient to get to takoma metro station. however these buses are more difficult to catch outside of the week days rush hours; when no bus is available, walking to/from the metro station is not too long (about 15 min.). finally, for people planning a long stay, a very slight inconvenient i would mention is that ellen's washing machine and dryer are located in the part of the house (in the basement) which houses two other people. anyway, this was not a big deal and overall my experience at ellen's place was a very good one! "
262629,5888750,2013-07-21,5595384,Danielle,ellen nicely welcomed me. she gave me a lot of information about the place and transprts. she gives you the impression to be a vip guest.her home is confortable and my bedroom with bathroom really perfect.

262629,9379228,2013-12-25,6514671,Hannah,ellen was a fantastic host and always made me feel welcomed in her home during my four month stay. she was always so helpful and willing to inform me of local events etc. the room and private bath are beautiful. ellen's home is in an excellent location - a short walk to the metro and in a pleasant neighborhood. i would absolutely recommend ellen to anyone staying in the dc area.  
266852,730488,2011-11-19,1366531,Sal,i liked ken's family and the area in which he lives. his room and bathroom in the basement have separate entrance. the kitchen in the pictures is on the 1st floor not basement.

266852,790298,2011-12-17,1417358,Christina,"this is my third time staying with ken and nicole. they are so accomodating and have added new features for their place to be even more convenient to guests. they recently installed a keypad for easier guest access at anytime. they also provide maps and guides for guests to be more familiar with the area. the home is beautiful and the room is always comfortable and clean. wonderul home and wonderful family...i would highly recommend this place!!

266852,945407,2012-02-24,1377331,Alvaro,"our stay with the mogul family has been our best airbnb experience!!
they are a very nice family and they made us feel like at home, they really shared their house with us and helped us a lot organising our visit. our stay in dc would not have been the same without them!
the house is just perfect, you have everything you could need and the location is great, in a very nice, quiet and safe neighbourhood within walking distance to union station, the capitol and the national mall.
100% recommended!!!

266852,1067343,2012-04-01,438150,Karen,"nicole and ken were great hosts - considerate and accommodating. wow, what a well designed space!  i loved everything about it. spotless, uncluttered, clean lined, all details very well thought out. and a cat to end all cats! friendly, always there at the door to greet us. their place is an excellent value too. "
266852,1096009,2012-04-08,1550820,Steinunn,me and my 18 year old daughter stayed in the mogul residence for a week.  we were very happy with everything.  nicole was very helpful.  beautiful environment and perfect to have a bike rental (to bike to the metro and in capitol hill) just at out private door.  we will surely recommend staying there and would do it again :)
266852,1124182,2012-04-13,1857676,David,"great folks, warm and welcoming.  right from the start the communication was terrific.  the space is cozy and charming, and private, with a private entry through the alley.  everything was clean and neat, good internet connection, a parking pass for on-street parking, good sheets and towels and other amenities.  the room itself is a bit small, but the heart is big, and therefor well worth it."
266852,1146884,2012-04-18,321542,Janice,"the place was fabulous! very clean and privacy. the moguls have two poster-size maps of washington, dc (metro subway and bike routes) on the wall. they are very friendly and thoughtful people. the neighborhood is very nice. they provided me a breakfast meal during my four-night stay. i would definitely go back to their place if i visit dc again. "
266852,1166511,2012-04-23,1582387,Jens,"we received a very warm welcome with ken and nicole and their two wonderful children. the place was neat and tidy and the bed an absolute delight. very good for couples who don’t like sleeping in tiny french beds. the room even had a tv with a moviechannel one could use in bad weather.  the bikeshare just behind their house was great fun and easy to use, and you could even walk into the city (about half an hour if you wanted to). should we be in washington again sometime we will definitely stay there again ! thank you !"
266852,1183435,2012-04-26,1601688,Teresa,"this was my first airbnb experience and i can't speak well enough of it! my son and i were on an adventure from california and absolutely loved staying with nicole, ken and their beautiful girls! even their dog and cat were a great element in our lovely stay. the accommodations were ideal for us. nobody was home when we arrived, but the instructions on how to enter the separate entrance directly into our suite were very clear and made for easy access. very comfortable bed, great shower, easy entrance to the suite. a light breakfast and coffee were a nice start to our mornings. ken and nicole's home is ideally located right by a capital bike share station, which was our mode of transportation throughout our dc adventure.they are big proponents of public transit, something of which i am, or, was, completely novice. ken and nicole made us feel comfortable with the notion of walking the mile to union station as we were departing, and convinced me that the nyc subway system was very user-friendly for the next leg of our adventure. sure enough, we're successfully navigating nyc transit with ease!

if/when i get the opportunity to visit dc again, i will definitely look forward to staying with ken and nicole again.

i am thrilled with airbnb and look forward to experiencing more throughout my future travels!"
266852,1214673,2012-05-02,1469151,Matthew And Thao,"we had a lovely time staying with ken and his family. from the minute we arrived we felt very welcome in their home, and had some great conversations and picked up some helpful local tips. we were provided with everything we could possibly have needed, and nicole was so kind as to fix some breakfast for us the morning we departed. the room itself is perfect - warm, excellent bathroom, big comfortable bed, and the added luxury of netflix was brilliant. though our stay was fairly short, i'm sure we'll remember it very fondly."
266852,1253812,2012-05-09,2129038,Karla,"i thoroughly enjoyed my stay with ken, nicole and their girls.they are helpful and interesting hosts. they live in a beautiful neighborhood with nearby transportation options. the room has everything you need and is very private, with your own entrance to come and go as you please. i would be happy to stay here again and would recommend it without hesitation."
266852,1269980,2012-05-13,1722069,Corey,"this was my first time using airbnb & it was a great experience! i didn't get to see nicole, ken, or the kids all that much, though they were all quite friendly. their pets on the other hand were all to happy to accept whatever attention i offered. i'm an animal lover, so that was fine with me. overall it really felt more like i was staying with friends or family, rather than staying with strangers.

i liked being able to come & go as i pleased without having to worry about disturbing their family schedule, and their home was close enough for me to bike to all of the museums & monuments on the national mall. there was even a place to lock my bike up right by my entrance. they also made some room for me in their fridge so i could pack a lunch, have some drinks/snacks, and even offered me some homemade cookies!

"
266852,1283030,2012-05-15,1605397,Raul,"ken, nicole, their two daughters and two pets are a great family with the best cozy nice home in dc, for sure. they'll make you feel like in your home. thank you very much for that breif stay but unforgettable. "
266852,1293043,2012-05-17,1577678,Sarah,"really comfortable bedroom and shower, utterly privateand beautifully quiet,  an easy walk from union station in a very pretty part of dc. ken and nicole and the girls (and pets) very welcoming and friendly, delicious fruit breakfast. it was lovely to be there, and i would certainly recommend it. i hope to go again one day!"
266852,1298885,2012-05-18,2112254,Jamie Lynn,"staying in the mogul home was a huge highlight of our dc trip! such a warm, welcoming, gorgeous place and exactly what i had hoped for. this was my first air bnb experience and i am a full-blown convert now thanks to the moguls! who wants a sterile hotel when you can have the privilege of staying in an authentic dc row house with some awesome, interesting, hip hosts? we had our own private entrance, clean beautiful bedroom, awesome bathroom, walking distance to all the museums and hot spots of dc, and a hostess like nicole to give us advice on what to see, what restaurants to eat at, etc. i felt so at ease from the moment i walked in and heard npr on the radio and smelled her delicious cooking. their daughters and animals were adorable. ken and nicole were professional in all their correspondence leading up to the visit and left nothing to be desired in the way of directions to their place, door code, etc. they were more than hospitable. overall, i felt like i could not have been luckier in ending up at the mogul home. thank you again for everything."
266852,1360314,2012-05-28,1362698,Sylvie,génial!! nous avons adoré!accueil très famillial!!supers petits déjeuners! famille adorable!!à deux pas de la location des vélos!idéal pour visiter wasington dc!à recommander absolument!!
266852,1370805,2012-05-29,1854627,Joyce,"ken and nicole were kind hosts. they have a beautiful home and the room was great with your own bathroom and private access door, and they had this folder with helpful suggestions on how to get around and food options. we wished we had more time in washington to spend with their lovely family. "
266852,1392405,2012-06-01,1683927,Celia,"our stay at ken & nicol was super! the room & house were  exactly like we expected it to be. the place was neat and clean, very nice interior. both them & the rest of the family and also dog & cat were very friendly and open.  nicole speaks many languages whereof one is dutch! they are very friendly and we liked the relaxed & helpfull atmosfere. the neigbourhood is also very nice, and there are bikes easy to rent or borrow.
definetly a great place to stay, we would for sure on any return to washington stay  with them again.

266852,1402744,2012-06-02,2487861,Atalia,"the moguls were lovely, the room is in a great location, totally private and very nice. i highly recommend staying with them! "
266852,1431082,2012-06-07,1928740,Lance,"ken and nicole made us feel welcome and we were comfortable in their home.  we enjoyed the girls very much.   the thought of the dog and cat had given us some trepidation, but they are well behaved and no trouble at all.  their home is conveniently located, and finding this alternative to the cost of a  downtown hotel made our stay in washington d.c. possible.  "
266852,1454067,2012-06-11,1775229,Duncan,"excellent location especially with the bike share program. combining it with metro made it really easy to get around. private room in the basement is very comfortable. free movies on netflix is a nice touch.

ken and nicole are great hosts, very comfortable to be with and extremely well organized. "
266852,1494530,2012-06-16,2590215,Matthew,"the room was just as advertised. clean, comfortable and convenient. due to work in the back yard, the private entrance was not accessible, but this is doubtless temporary. the house is a 20 minute walk to capitol hill, and a couple of blocks from restaurants. ken and nicole themselves are very nice, friendly and helpful, and extremely respectful of my privacy. i enjoyed meeting them."
266852,1519676,2012-06-19,553787,Sarah,"super sweet little suite- great location, nice hosts. stay here!
"
266852,1525233,2012-06-20,2549532,Edward,"ken and nicole are great hosts. the room is cosy, charming, private. location is in a real dc neighborhood close to everything!. if want to get to know dc ""the city"" as well as the tourist itinerary  this is the place. thank you ken and nicole!"
266852,1537776,2012-06-22,2104188,Ann Marie,ken and nicole and family (including cat and dog!) offer a very clean and comfortable suite in their lovely home. it was a welcome oasis after a day of touring and the breakfast the following morning was a plus. the information that they provide in the guest notebook was a big help and a timesaver in getting to know the neighborhood. a very nice place to stay while in dc.
266852,1551314,2012-06-24,2611294,John,"the moguls were very kind and generous hosts, and their home is beautiful and welcoming. the room and bathroom are in the basement, so there is plenty of privacy. everything was clean, comfortable, and welcoming. a few things to keep in mind: their home is about a 20 min. walk to attractions and the metro (although there are some great restaurants a few blocks away). however, the bikeshare program in dc makes getting around very easy and there may have been a metro or bus stop that we did't discover. the kitchen is right above the bedroom, and you can hear people walking around. one night there was a unique situation where they got home late and that did wake us up. but, that was very minor, and the bedroom is otherwise very quiet.  i can't think of a better place to stay in dc, and we would happily come again. "
266852,1677085,2012-07-10,2610987,Yijia,"we can totally relax at mogul's basement after a whole day traveling in dc, because we had enough privacy and every detail has been considered by host, like parking, washing, wifi, ac etc. besides, moguls are really nice, the pets are cute and friendly (don't worry about the pets, they behaved very well), and the whole apartment is bright and beautiful. it is my first time using airbnb, and it is a great start!"
266852,1752833,2012-07-20,129694,Allison,"this was the first time i had ever booked a place on airbnb, so i was a little clueless. but, i lucked out! 

ken and nicole were wonderful hosts and their home is lovely. every morning, i got up, grabbed a bike (city bike share), rode to eastern market metro station, jumped on the metro and went off to work. it was so much more fun than staying in a hotel.

meeting ken, nicole and their two girls was the highlight of my trip. i hope someday i'll be able to return!"
266852,1765038,2012-07-21,2539752,Peter Albert,pleasant. comfortable. responsive. perfectly satisfied. convenient location. good value. recommended. friendly. (barking dog- also friendly)
266852,1788038,2012-07-24,2474927,Michelle,"i had a fantastic stay with ken and nicole, too short unfortunately. the accommodation was fantastic and they were perfect hosts.  this was my first time using airbnb and ken and nicole have set a very high standard. i highly recommend this accommodation for your next stay in washington. "
266852,1903301,2012-08-06,799449,Julie,"we only met ken on our stay as his family was out of town, but he was a great host! he was really flexible when our travel dates changed at the last minute and very considerate about their construction happening out back. we really enjoyed chatting with him and found their guide book and framed subway maps very helpful! he even offered to drop us off at union station on our way out. 

their location is close to trains via the bike rentals out back. if you're walking, be prepared to walk 20 minutes or so to the nearest train. you're also close to h street which offers a plethora of restaurants and bars to choose from. overall, a great spot that we'd definitely stay in again. "
266852,1951260,2012-08-11,3027951,Damaris,we only met ken as his family was out of town. he was a great host! he was friendly and respectful of our privacy. little rock (their cat) was so adorable! we will miss him. the place was clean and offered privacy as the room was on the basement. it was also very conveniently located close to h street which offered lots of restaurants and bars to choose from. there were also buses that took us near the train stations. definitely recommend staying here.
266852,1973650,2012-08-13,1737577,Logan,"ken's place was awesome. my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay in the lovely downstairs/basement area that was totally private and convenient. it was so nice to have an extremely comfortable bed and private bathroom. the neighborhood was great too, it seemed to be full of families and many dogs! speaking of dogs, or pets for that matter, the dog and cat at the mogul's are the sweetest! my friend and i often returned after 11pm but we always felt completely safe walking from union station to the place. the walk from union station probably takes around 15-20 minutes, but it's a great walk-especially on a warm summer night. the mogul's is a fantastic place to stay! it's clean, comfortable, welcoming, in a great location, and makes dc feel like home! "
266852,2003175,2012-08-16,1263287,Cari,"even though we did not meet ken or his family while we were staying here, everything went smoothly. this is the perfect home base for one or two people exploring dc. the neighborhood is really nice and the house is between several buses that take you downtown, to union station and to metro stops. although the family was on vacation, they were easily reached if we had any questions and were quick to respond. 

the suite itself is simply decorated and the a/c unit was a great relief for summer travel! the bedroom and bathroom are a little tight and more ""european"" then some american travelers might be used to but was not a problem for us. the suite was very clean and even though it is in a basement, it didn't feel like it! their cat little rock is extremely friendly and kept us company while we were here. 

ken and his family left us a very helpful binder with information about the neighborhood, bus stops, other transportation options (a bike share spot is close by as well) and restaurant recommendations. we tried shwafel for dinner the first night and were impressed with their shwarma. the next night we tried a new pizza place h&pizza which was amazing! if you are staying for several days, the whole h street area is full of good looking restaurants with a variety of options. 

we had a great time in dc and would definitely consider staying here again in the future.

266852,2067479,2012-08-22,3116101,Louise,"we can highly recommend staying with ken and nicole, we felt immediately at home with them.they are nice, open and interested in you.

the room is very good, and have a good bed and a private bathroom.
the place is located in a beautiful area and close to union station and a nice walking distance from the center.

"
266852,2142631,2012-08-30,2490392,Katharina,i'm reviewing ken and nicole twice because we stayed two nights longer at their apartment. as hurricane isaac hit new orleans we had to change our travel planes. we were glad to get the opportunity to stay longer at nicole and ken's. they were great host and we highly recommend this apartment to everyone! 
266852,2167140,2012-09-01,2490392,Katharina,"ken and nicole have been great hosts. the apartment was nice and comfortable. when our flight to new orleans was canceled, it was absolutely no problem to extend our stay and we were very happy to do so. we really enjoyed our stay with nicole, ken, their children and pets. we absolutely recommend and would definitely go again! thank you nicole and ken :-)"
266852,2189939,2012-09-04,1908163,Elodie,"nous avons passé un très bon moment chez ken. la chambre est très bien, très propre. ken et sa femme nous ont donné de très bons conseils. ils sont disponibles et à l'écoute. à recommander."
266852,2235254,2012-09-08,3417876,Victoria,"a really nice host and lovely children and pets!! we got a parking permit which is brilliant to have in dc.
unfortunately the room is just too small and despite the air condition was on all night, we both had a bad sleep due to too little air. we could´t use the extra entrance due to constructions and the bathroom was also under constructing. 
"
266852,2259496,2012-09-11,2100457,Ramona,"it was the first time we tried airbnb and we weren't disappointed at all! ken and nicoel were great hosts and gave us everything we needed. also the two girls, little rock (cat) and lilly (dog) were super nice :-) the house and our bedroom (+bathroom) were clean and comfortable. 
 
the house is situated close to downtown, you can easily get to the most famous sights by bike (they have bike share stations everywhere for 7 dollars a day) or by metro if you prefer that. it is also great that you can get a parking permit for free for your car. 

all in all, it was a great experience to live at nicole's and ken's house and we think we'll try airbnb again during our next vacation! 

thank you for everything!

266852,2748501,2012-10-29,61534,Natalia,"we absolutely enjoyed our room,  the house, and the moguls in general! we had a separate entrance, which was very convenient! the only less-than-optimal elements were the distance from the metro and the fact that the room is directly below the kitchen and dining area so every footstep is heard downstairs. overall, we had a great time!"

266852,3089433,2012-12-14,839889,Davide,"ken, nicole et al, are lovely an gracious, in between getting the girls off to school.  room is private with separate entrance, neighborhood is close to key spots of the city, and h street has excellent eateries, some with great beers.  lillie (le chien) is truly one of the sweetest canines in the world.  my only regret: did not meet the cat; did not stay a few more days."
266852,3166550,2012-12-27,4310981,Ethan,"this was my first airbnb experience and it was fairly interesting. ken & nicole are wonderful hosts and were kind enough to let us do our laundry as we were running out of clean clothes. the room in the basement is fairly small and cramp, but it is really clean and tidy. bonus is that we had our own personal bath/toilet too.
the area was nice, especially around x'mas with all the decor put up by the surrounding neighbours. it felt safe when walking around at night and the convenience of the rental bikes from opposite the field was great. this allowed us to cycle to union station or to the mall with all the attractions.
the downside to the place is that due to the wooden floorboards from the floor above, it gets really noisy. if you like to sleep-in, then maybe it's not the best place to be at. the cabin in the backyard would be more suitable then! :)"
266852,3180277,2012-12-29,4159827,Jim,"we enjoyed our two day stay with ken and nicole.  the accommodations were cozy, clean, and convenient, and they live in an interesting part of town that's quite central.  nicole was super organized and communicated all the details well before our arrival. we were especially glad that they welcomed our dog cosmo who was traveling with us.  thanks!"
266852,3254272,2013-01-03,2990889,Lilly,ken and nicole were wonderful hosts. they were very helpful---sending us clear instructions on how to get to their house and offering warm cups of tea. nicole even gave us free tickets for one of the museums were wanted to visit! highly recommend them as airbnb'ers.
266852,3274467,2013-01-05,3644118,Benjamin,nicole and ken are lovely hosts. they upgraded us to their newly build cabin in their backyard which is not only cozy but also the perfect place to stay without disturbing the two in their daily lives. it has an own little kitchen and bathroom and all important things one might need for a stay in d.c. the neighborhood is quiet and one can reach the bus or metro easily to get into the city center and to all important sights and points of interests. also nicole and ken have the most lovely cat on earth who greeted us on the first day and stayed and cuddled with us in our cabin for a couple of hours.
266852,3316985,2013-01-09,428269,Anna,the room was very clean and nice. ken and nicole are very nice people and they made everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible.  it was a pleasure for us to stay at theirs and we would definitely recommend their room in washington dc.

266852,3409764,2013-01-25,3768630,Sandra,"la maison est charmante et l'espace chambre et salle de bain est très agréable(grand lit, grande douche). de plus, l'netrée séparée offre une autonomie vraiment appréciable surtout si on ne veut pas déranger la famille. les hotes (nicole et ken) sont des gens formidables, disponibles et sympathiques, ce fut un plaisir de discuter avec eux ! "
266852,3482663,2013-02-05,4133294,Zoe,"staying with ken and nicole for a weekend in washington dc was fantastic. they were a lovely family and were incredibly welcoming and generous. the room was comfortable and clean, and the house was right next to a capitol bike share, which was an excellent way to see the city. we would definitely recommend staying with ken and nicole! "
266852,3544923,2013-02-15,3559678,Sara,"the family mogul (including dog and cat) is wonderful, they know how to be friendly and welcoming without being intrusive. the room provides great privacy and the neighborhood is nice and safe. i highly recommend you go!"
266852,3578557,2013-02-18,1180226,Arun,"i had a great time staying at ken & nicole's lovely abode. the house is perfect for guests because it comes with a private entrance. they also have an adorable pup, and a cat named little rock, who coincidentally had his birthday on the same day i checked in, which meant free pizza and beer. come on, no host can top that :) 

the house itself is well built, and recently renovated. the doors for the entrance come bolted with a pass code lock, which means you don't really need to carry a clumsy key. i mean, that's so 1940's anyway. there is also a a huge park right next door if you want to exercise, and a dog park which was plenty useful for me. 

the neighborhood also has plenty of coffee shops, bars, grocery stores. this is a great place ! "
266852,3600405,2013-02-22,3663298,Emily,"ken and nicole are wonderful hosts! the suite is very clean and just spacious enough for two people. the neighbourhood is great, there are tons of good restaurants within walking distance. having the bikeshare so close was very convenient as well. my friend & i happened to be in town on president's day and we were allowed to tag along with their family to visit mount vernon! i don't think any host can top that. we had a great time in dc and would highly recommend staying here."
266852,3653475,2013-02-28,2806780,Margarita,"stayed for just 5 nights but it was exactly what i needed: super clean, homy, quiet, comfortable, and in a convenient location right next to  capitol of u.s., with plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. nicole and ken are so nice hosts.would highly recommend staying here."
266852,3735343,2013-03-10,191266,Helen,"anna and i were delighted with our stay. after sightseeing among the marble buildings  and museums, it was especially pleasant to make our way in the  neighborhood to thier lovely, tastefully designed home. we felt perfectly safe all hours of the day.    our accommodations were exactly as shown on the internet  - clean - very comfortable - privacy - what couldn't be shown was the genuine hospitality and welcoming we felt from nicole and ken.   i especially appreciated nicole's conern when i injured my knee. the children were delightful, the pets were affectionate - it was a great experience to share a family's day-to-day life when you are in a new city. definitely would recommend staying here again.    "
266852,3764282,2013-03-12,5064620,Maradel,"a comfortable, clean room with bath in a very friendly household.  the family is very nice, and the pets are great -- the cat kept me company one night when his family was out.  as a single woman traveler, i felt very comfortable staying here -- the neighborhood seemed safe for walking, and there are convenient bus connections to nearby metro stops if you don't feel like walking the 25 minute distance."
266852,3793630,2013-03-15,4334036,Hanna,we were very pleased with staying at this private suite. we highly valued the privacy - we had our own entrance and we could easily move in and out without bothering anybody at any time. the bedroom had tv with good set of movies. there was a private bathroom with shower. i recommend it for couples! all you need for relaxing after meeting the city. the neighbourhood seemed very safe and family friendly. thank you:)!
266852,3851942,2013-03-21,4181464,Vyacheslav,i can strongly recommend everybody to stay here.you 'll never find anybody better than ken and nicole mogul in washington.

266852,4031712,2013-04-04,1521103,Francesca,"we stayed at the moguls for 3 nights. they're the greatest hosts, so easygoing and attentive. the room and the bathroom are small, essential but cozy, comfortable and extremely clean. their house is close (as for dc can be) to the mall. we had bikes with us and the position allowed us to visit comfortably all we wanted to see.
my only regret is that they were in dc only the last day we were there. we certainly would have liked to spend some more time chatting with them and their wonderful daughters.
when and if we'll go back to dc is at their place that we'd like to stay again.
francesca & pietro"
266852,4057807,2013-04-06,4884739,Holly,"ken and nicole were most accommodating.  the room and bathroom were very clean and all our needs were met.  they even provided us with a binder of instructions, useful maps of the area, eatery suggestions, and a most valuable parking pass for the capitol hill area.  a real plus for us was having a bikeshare station right behind the house.  and, little rock is a wonderfully friendly feline companion!"

266852,4112863,2013-04-10,1827607,Pamela,"the location was great.  centrally located in a safe neighborhood.  we walked home from the metro after 9pm on two nights and never felt ""uneasy"".  the room is just what we were looking for - bed, closet, bathroom with shower, easy/private access and clean.  breakfast was too early for our retired lifestyle but there are many options in and around the metro stations (20-30 minutes walks).  the proprietors were friendly and helpful.  we will definitely look them up the next time we go to that area!  we enjoyed washington dc there is so much to see and do.  highlight for us  the cherry blossoms were in full bloom on the day we left. wonderful great 3 day trip! 
thanks again ken & nicole"

le logement est très propre (conforme à ce qui est présenté sur internet). et avec une entrée indépendante très pratique. 
ken est un hôte très sympathique , accueillant  et toujours disponible. nous avons beaucoup discuté et échangé sur nos style de vie respectifs.
nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre séjour à washington,  ville  emblématique de l'histoire des etats unis..
nous vous recommandons cette adresse.

266852,5885796,2013-07-21,5434228,Sinead & Eamon,"the location is convenient to h street (five minute walk), where, as recommended by ken, there were a lot of nice places to eat. 

in addition to that, it is about a 20 minute walk to union station, where you can take the metro anywhere you wish to go.  there is also a very convenient bike share station right around the corner, which would make getting anywhere pretty easy.  perfect location for the dc tourist.

the neighbourhood seemed quite safe and friendly.  both nights we arrived home in the wee hours with no issues at all.

the room was self-contained and could be accessed without going through the front of the house.  this was great as it made it easier to come and go as we pleased without feeling like we'd be disturbing this nice family.  

the room itself is new.  i believe there had been some improvements done before we arrived and it was very clean.  there was a small electric ice box, a microwave and even a kettle and coffee maker.  plenty of closet space for the traveller and the bathroom was very suitable with a spacious shower.  while we did not use the television, there was one squarely in front of the bed that was hooked up to a sophisticated system.  pretty cool.  it had it's own climate control system for the room, which could be set at 70 and working wifi.

would recommend."

also the family cat is adorable -- he welcomed us home one night and was one of the friendliest cats i've ever met! i'd definitely recommend staying here in dc."

266852,8881629,2013-11-24,6873560,Rachel,"extremely welcoming and approachable easy-going hosts! so much privacy and all the facilities required for your stay - netflix, hair dryer, towels, ipod speakers, microwave etc. super modern, clean and cosy. highly recommend!"

266852,9112326,2013-12-08,8385649,Celine,"superb room in a perfect place. the neighbourhood is really nice and quiet, and also closed to downtown. the room was clean and well fitted. nicole and her family were so helpfull, attentive and kind. to have a great stay in dc , we highly recommend nicole and ken's place!"
266852,9225728,2013-12-15,5813645,Natacha,"we had a lovely stay in washington dc and would definitely recommend staying at ken and nicole's place. nicole gave us a warm welcome and she even spoke french! she was really friendly and easy to talk to. she provided breakfast for us, that was really nice before going out for a full day of visit. she was also helpful in arranging a taxi for us when we left. the room was great, clean, with a private bathroom and a seperate access, and a lot of information provided about the neighborhood!"
266852,9284855,2013-12-18,4082678,Jamie,clean and comfortable. private access with key code door lock was very convenient. a bit noisy when family is moving around the kitchen directly above the room.
266852,9379258,2013-12-25,6104089,María,ken & nicole are wonderful guests. the place is great. dont lose the oportunity to know them. 
284165,858464,2012-01-12,788757,Jena,the house is fantastic! ethan is incredibly responsive to anything you need and it has really felt like home. 
284165,1161477,2012-04-21,878992,David,the carriage house is impeccable. ethan was a helpful and flexible host.
284165,1338928,2012-05-24,1432917,Tiffany,"convenient location. nice two level carriage house, has all amenities and privacy. 

my only complaint was the daily construction, made for lack of early morning quiet some days. appears as if they were finishing upon my departure so this wil likely not be a problem for anyone else. 

overall great place, ton of amenities, would stay again!"
284165,2012737,2012-08-17,62491,Dominic,"eclectic and cool . entering this converted carriage house through the garage and from the enormous alley is unique. the unit has a large kitchen and dining area for those staying longer or wishing to eat in. the living/sleeping area is large enough for 4-6 people to lounge around. however the bedding is only for 2. the couch and the air matress would accomodate more. stackable washer and dryer is a nice added touch. dont miss the courtyard for early morning relaxation. unit was tidy but probably would not meet the ""germophobes"" standards. bamboo floors beat dirty hotel carpet any day. spiral staircase to living area only presented problem carrying the largest and heaviest luggage up. however, you could leave some downstairs, plenty of room.  parking was actually much easier then expected and location is excellent for quick access to subway or the crazy dc roads. ethan was very helpful and friendly. check in and out was easy. the internet access was good and having the desk was great. we would stay again. "
284165,2094184,2012-08-25,3258524,Julia,"ethan was a gracious, warm and informative host. we enjoyed our stay in his carriage house immensely. the space is airy, clean and inviting. the neighborhood is very charming, with good places to eat (we went to shaw's tavern twice!) and lovely architecture. also, we drove down and had no trouble parking close by. thanks to ethan's generosity, our trip to dc was a great success. "
284165,2797607,2012-11-04,1960088,Matias,"it's taken me way too long to write this review, but what a gem of a place. i spent about two consecutive months there in late 2012 and loved it. the house itself is very comfortable and practical. i didn't really know the neighborhood before i took it up and was very surprised by the variety of good places to eat, drink, listen to music and hang around. since i was staying for quite a stint, i got myself a bike -- absolutely worth it. the whole area is undergoing major renovation (and gentrification), but still retains a lot of charm. ethan was a great host as well -- gave me lots of good tips about the city and the neighborhood, and was really easy to deal with regarding the house. i would definitely stay there again."
284165,2854983,2012-11-11,3307434,Estelle,"ethan was very easy to reach and pro-active to answer. the appartment was small though for 3 people. i would recommend it for a couple.
due to the storm, the tv was out of order...

great host still

thanks "
284165,4093084,2013-04-09,3708592,Gabriel,"i was in dc for a conference with some coworkers. we found ethan friendly, his flat was as described, and it located in a great part of town. my friends and i really enjoyed staying there, and we'd do it again. i definitely recommend. "
284165,4193988,2013-04-17,3034978,Donna,"we enjoyed our stay at the carriage house. the location was perfect for our needs. it is convenient to the subway and the neighborhood offers amenities we enjoy such as great coffee shops. the apartment was clean, comfortable, and quiet.  ethan responded quickly to a request we made during our visit. we hope ethan's rental will be available on our next trip to dc. "
284165,4347326,2013-04-29,81052,Karey,"we were a group of 4 staying in the carriage house for 4 nights.  with the pull out couch on the lower level and the couch and bed on the upper level, it is cozy but definitely doable for 4 people.
ethan was a great host and was flexible with check in and check out times.  also, the restaurant suggestions were amazing!
thanks ethan!"
284165,4647795,2013-05-18,2992052,Kevin,"had a great experience at ethan's place. the apartment is spacious and comfortable, the amenities are great, and everything in d.c. is really close at hand. encountered a special situation where i needed to receive mail, and he accommodated without hesitation. highly recommended."
284165,4687003,2013-05-20,6151995,Mandy,"ethan's place was great!  it was perfect for my family to relax in over my graduation weekend.  ethan was accommodating, reachable, and very helpful to any questions that we had.  the place is really great, the ideal size for four people to comfortably sleep, and had everything we needed to make our stay wonderful.  i would definitely stay here again!"
284165,5882081,2013-07-21,5703091,Tom,"two floor carriage house. why don't we call it what it is, a two floor apartment in a garage. the entrance is down a dirty smelly ally. you enter the building only to smell gasoline, that's because they store motor scooters in the same building. the owner states it sleeps four but when i asked for an extra key, he made an issue of it and never provided me with one. the air conditioning unit broke down often and if you have ever been in dc in june and july you know how bad that! the owner states that he is often away on business and has no management company to handle any problems that did arise. i travel on business weekly and i must say it was the most disappointing place i rented over the past year. please note that the medical center is a few blocks away so the police and ambulance sirens that are heard throughout the evening are increased with activity throughout the weekend. if you are planning a lengthy stay please know that the closest supermarket is a 15-minute drive.
in ending all i can say is"
284165,6036271,2013-07-27,2886853,Mk,"ethan's place was just as described. it wasn't too far from the u street area, though for those who don't like to walk might consider it to be a bit of a walk. my guy and i didn't stay in for long periods of time, but it was nice that the ac cooled the place off quickly and little things like having an iron and a coffeepot were really helpful. also, for those into sports, my guy was absolutely delighted to find out that we had fox soccer on tv. everything was clean and comfortable. ethan, as a host, was great even though i didn't get to meet him. but we were in touch regularly over my stay since we had to check in late and check out early. he was easy to reach and got back to me promptly each time.

286083,950288,2012-02-26,1734932,Emma,"everything the listing promised and more: lovely apartment, great host and lively, interesting neighborhood."
286083,962288,2012-03-01,479310,Charlie,"amos' apartment is great.  spacious, good design, comfortable.  cozying up by the fireplace is the best!  he's a great host too--good communication and very helpful.  totally enjoyed my stay and hope to again."
286083,1009186,2012-03-17,1846697,Amanda,"this was a great first time experience with airbnb!  amos was quick to respond to my booking inquiry and easy to contact as our arrival date neared.  unbelievably, we got into town at nearly 10 p.m. and he was at the door with keys and a primed with a quick tour of his place.

location-wise, this neighbourhood was great!  it's a short walk to adams morgan, columbia heights and kalorama but because the march weather was phenomenal, we also strolled as far as the monuments and georgetown.  cabs were easy to come by, the bus is only a block or so away and those red rental bikes are too convenient - a definite recommendation.

thanks again amos for the great place!  with an outfitted kitchen, a living room perfect for lounging and a bedroom tucked back from the street, this made for a great recharge spot for a treasured visit to d.c."
286083,1016552,2012-03-19,993628,Zee,"nice place; vaulted ceilings, hdtv (plenty of channels), accessible to adams morgan, 7-11 and other convenience stores located on the same block. parking was typical dc. amos was very helpful and friendly. my only request is a higher bed ...lol. apt is on the top floor so it's steps all the way, but the privacy and view of the city is well worth it. otherwise, i had an awesome time. "
286083,1058822,2012-03-29,1878286,Neal,"had a great stay here at amos place. it was exactly as advertised and amos is a wonderful host. a superb location for us in mount pleasant, close by to lots of good places to eat (some on the way into the apartment) and easy to get to areas in the arts district in p where we were working. highly recommended for the visiting cultural crowd who want a great mix of comfort and location."
286083,1082543,2012-04-04,1761496,Karl Hans,"amos is a nice guy and the ap. is tastefully furnished and partly with a nice view. for 4 pers. the ap. is to small. its' situated in an old, historical part of washington. we liked it. the way to the tube was a little bit fare (15 min. walk)."
286083,1088753,2012-04-06,1636974,James,"very nice place, everything was as advertised, except the main room looked even better in person than in the photo.  amos was friendly and helpful.  wish we had spent more time in the apartment and less on the street as we were very comfortable while staying there.  economical choice for traveling with two kids, who slept on the sofas, but this would also be a fine and reasonably priced option for one or two adults without kids.  use of the washing machine and dryer was an extra bonus.  good neighborhood, mix of ethnicities without feeling like it was dominated by any one of them, felt safe, and some good restaurants and bakeries.  only drawback was lack of blinds on the bedroom window; in spain we are used to hermetic blinds that block all morning light, and here the top half of the bedroom window is completely uncovered (no privacy problem, just too much light in the morning).  "
286083,1293378,2012-05-17,557432,Cynthia,we had a very nice time in mount pleasant and amos' apartment and amos was a great host.
286083,1360609,2012-05-28,1611744,Linda,"well, where to begin!
the shower, we all loved the shower. after a hot day of site seeing, shopping, etc. the shower was a blessing. 
the condo is so beautiful. well equipped with anything you might need for cooking, (we ate out most of the time, we were on vacation!), but if you wanted to cook there was everything that you might need. 
a plus was the mt. pleasant tonic downstairs, and the pizza place (which for some reason we didn't get to). and for anyone thinking the condo would be noisy because of the restaurants downstairs, once you walked through the main front door, there was absolute quiet.
our last night we sat on the deck, looking at the moon. we do wish we had done that more during our stay of 10 days. wonderful.
the neighborhood is vibrant, the farmer's market was on the square a half of block up from the condo on saturday. beautiful produce, honey and jams.
the metro is so close! south on mt pleasant, turn left on irving and straight ahead. convenient!!
and amos was a wonderful host. "
286083,1420905,2012-06-05,845298,Chris,"we were in town for a wedding and this was a perfect place for a small group of us to all stay together.  the property is charming and larger than it looks in the photos, and the location is great - walking distance to adams morgan and the u street areas, plus just a few blocks to the metro. amos was a gracious host and even let the early arrivers check in a little early.  he met them at the apartment and gave them a tour.  the shower was also amazing - like being in a waterfall!"
286083,1556567,2012-06-25,1444580,Jessica,"this apartment was wonderful for myself and friends to stay in for 2 weeks! the kitchen was well equipped, living room was very comfortable, and apartment itself felt very safe. the neighborhood was nice and close to the metro. amos was very helpful in answering questions and was there right when we got there to check us in. "
286083,1857696,2012-08-01,1982866,Leon,"amos was a great host and his property was exactly as advertised. the location is particularly great, providing quick and easy access to and from dupont circle, the white house and other key d.c. sites via metro and bus. i had a great time and highly recommend this listing!

word to the wise if your sleep depends on darkness: bring a sleeping mask, as the morning light is bright in the bedroom."
286083,1965665,2012-08-13,1015362,Eric,"this apartment is absolutely wonderful, very comfortable and well (website hidden by airbnb) very nice with an outfitted kitchen.the bathroom is fantastic.
the neightbourhood is very nice and close to the metro.the bus is only a block.
but the most important is amos: he's very helpful and friendly.he's a great lost."
286083,2648610,2012-10-18,3501001,Donna,"this is a lovely, spacious, light filled apartment with a well appointed kitchen and a cozy gas fireplace.  the mt. pleasant neighborhood is fun and hip with lots of quaint restaurants and shops. if you prefer to shop at target or bed bath and beyond those are nearby too. the building was very quiet and the bar downstairs is a fun place to hang out. it is a quick bus or metro ride to the capitol, museums etc. amos was a fantastic host and was quick to respond to all of our questions. we would definitely stay here on future visits to dc. "
286083,2708628,2012-10-24,769252,Elizabeth,really clean and convenient place.  amos was very helpful.  i would definitely stay there again.  (sofa was truly comfortable!)
286083,3400116,2013-01-23,4103541,Ronnie,"for my first experience using airbnb i have to give the service an a. for my experience with amos i give him an a+. in short, amos was welcoming, punctual, responsive, and fun.  amos was a fantastic host that provided clear instructions for operating his unit, pointed out running trails, and local eateries. his penthouse sits in a great location and offers all the amenities to make for a comfortable if not lavish dc experience. being in town for the second inauguration for president obama was an exciting and fun-filled weekend for a small group of us, and amos’ apartment felt like home away from home – truly comfortable. i definitely plan stay at his boutique penthouse for future dc travel.
p.s. the shower is a little slice of heaven."
286083,3556550,2013-02-16,4530725,Pilar,"amos' apartment is amazing.  so comfortable and spacious.  and convenient to everything (restaurants, metro, bus)!  amos is a great host as well with super clear communication about the building."
286083,6130193,2013-07-31,6575753,Ricardo,"the place is spacious, well decorated and modern. amos is a very friendly guy. he responded quickly to all our questions. the location is good (plenty of buses around the corner plus the columbia heights metro station 10 minutes away walking). there are lots of big retail stores next to the metro station (e.g. best buy, giant, target), which is very convenient. if you like latin food, the place is surrounded by great places to grab a bite (peruvian, dominican, cuban, etc.). the zoo is 10 minutes away walking, which was a big plus for us: the zoo is amazing and also free! (we went there every weekend)."
286083,6666192,2013-08-20,6789521,Richard,"a wonderful vacation in a perfect location.   the apartment is easy access,  spacious  and very comfortable.   amos made us feel welcome when we checked in early.   we enjoyed reading the history of mt. pleasant in the book he left.  soft linens and lots of clean towels.  open the windows,  sit back and relax in the evening breezes.   we'd love to return.  "
286083,8265443,2013-10-22,1586242,Amanda,"amos was a fantastic host -- flexible on check in and check out and accommodated our dog. the apartment is just as described and very comfortable. lots of space, especially considering the location, and an amazing shower. my best airbnb experience to date!"
290001,1008379,2012-03-17,347943,Daniel,"jane was a great host and her place was perfect for our stay in dc. cool neighbourhood - close to shops, restaurants, public transport and cafes. the steam room shower combo was a treat at the end of a late winter's day. having the cat around, no trouble at all."
290001,1041180,2012-03-25,1202134,Avi,"jane was really a great host. i arrived earlier than expected and jane made sure that i'll have the keys to get into the house. the bed is really comfortable and the house is warm and ""homey"". if you are a cat lover you even get an extra treat as you will spend the days with her cat, who is very polite and just asks for a little love and food each day..
 
"
290001,1072625,2012-04-02,1574257,Alan,"our stay at jane's was very nice and the consensus is that we would do it again if we had the chance. i was surprised at how easy it was to get around the city by transit - including the circulator bus that got us to our conference at woodley park for $1 - and by foot. the house was cute and comfortable and both jane and tess (the cat) were very welcoming. it was an added bonus that a whole foods was so close and the curchkey had an amazing selection of beers; in fact, both p and 14th had a great selection of restaurants and bars to visit. as my first airbnb experience, i'm feeling good about the results. thanks jane!  "
290001,1090821,2012-04-06,1604742,Zareena,"jane went out of her way to accommodate my family of five!  we were all very comfortable in her home which is way more spacious than listed. location was great, house was super clean and kitty was very welcoming. i cannot say enough about the availability of three things:  steady wireless internet, washer/dryer and a garage for our out of state car. check mass transit schedules but walking is a great options as this is a lovely part of dc.  will book again. "
290001,1131197,2012-04-15,431069,Nicole,jane was a great host.  her house was perfect for our stay.  location was ideal.  we always walked to all the city main attractions.  the garage was really an avantage for us.  the house was spacious enough for our family of four and the wireless network was also very practical.
290001,1151149,2012-04-19,1794589,Alison,"jane was a great hostess! her apartment is so cute and cozy, within walking distance to most everything. she was very organized and pleasant to work with. great communication. i highly recommend staying with her! tess is also very friendly and loves to be around people. thanks for a wonderful experience!"
290001,1233651,2012-05-06,1857639,Benoit,"perfect and nice house, with a pretty cat. very conveniently located, fully equipped, i will definitively come back one day!"
290001,1262823,2012-05-11,2162671,Joe,"jane's house is perfect for a relaxing dc getaway. it's clean, warm and inviting. location could not be more ideal - only a 20 minute walk to the white house and a 5 minute walk to 14th street. it's located in a quiet and safe neighborhood close to many restaurants and a whole foods. tess, the cat, is not a bother and is quite friendly. next time we are in dc, we will definitely see if jane's home is available. i would highly recommend staying here!"
290001,1284474,2012-05-15,2045452,Elsha,"we thorougly enjoyed our stay at jane's house! we were in a great area - just a few minutes away from several delicious restaurants. the home itself was lovely, with wonderful art and a great collection of books. the parking located in the back made life a lot easier - especially since dc is such a tricky city for parking. we had a wonderful time, and will definitely be contacting jane if we visit dc again. "
290001,1362490,2012-05-28,2074907,Carsten,"jane house is a nice and comfortable place to stay in washington dc. travelling downtown by bus is very easy and and takes only 15 minutes. the bus station is around the corner.
we enjoyed our stay by jane!
jane's cat tess is lovely.
if we travel to dc again we would like to stay there again."
290001,1442023,2012-06-09,2091335,Meghan,"jane was very organised and friendly throughout the entire booking process and during our stay.  i stayed with two friends, using the two beds and the couch, for three nights mid-week.  

we found jane's home to be just right for us, very cozy as the description states but also very interesting - jane has travelled extensively and has some fascinating travel mementos and books throughout her lovely home.  tess, the cat was a joy to be around, very friendly and i was pleased to encounter a cat as i was missing my own back home!

the location is homely and local to logan circle, and within walking distance of the australian embassy which we visited during our stay, so that was convenient for us.  cabs into dc are a bit pricey and it will cost you $8-$10 to get one to the white house/major landmarks vicinity - there are also buses but we couldn't be bothered working them out during our short stay, and besides, we wanted to get the most out of dc during the time we had available.

jane provided a large range of maps and information about dc to help us settle in, as well as every other amenity we could have needed or wanted.  we were very happy with our first airbnb experience and will recommend it to others."
290001,1497432,2012-06-17,2269355,Paula,"staying at jane's townhouse was so nice.  it was in a good location with access to the circulator and the metro within walking distance.  the townhouse was clean, comfortable and cozy.  tess, the resident cat, is a delight and very easy to take care of.  i would definitely recommend jane's townhouse for a couple or 3 people who would rather stay in a homelike atmosphere.  my 2 sisters and i had a good time and were very comfortable."
290001,1522422,2012-06-20,2154702,Francie,"we had a wonderful stay at jane's logan circle home. the location was perfect, the neighborhood was beautiful, with many opportunities for walking to restaurants and attractions. tess the cat was good company and fun to have around. thank you jane! "
290001,1533721,2012-06-22,350802,Monica,"wonderful home and host. my husband, son and newphew had a great two night stay. we were able to walk to all of the sites and take and easy metro train ride to see a national's game. off street parking and close by dinner places and whole foods were an added perk. we love and miss tess the cat. thank you jane!!"
290001,1620462,2012-07-03,839657,Mark,"we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at jane's place in d.c.  we arrived in the midst of a record setting heat wave and the house was cool and clean when we got there in above 100 degree weather.  jane checked to make sure everything was okay and checked in with us again to see if we were okay the following day after an evening of severe thunderstorms.  we loved the location- walking distance to everything and all the info on the city that jane made available to us.  the parking spot in the back was an extra bonus- we left it there without having to worry about it and did not take it out again until we left.  we strongly recommend this home away from home if you plan to visit d.c.  
p.s.  jane even has the washington post delivered each morning!"
290001,1701859,2012-07-14,1967353,Johannes,"we were not disappointed with the stay in washington.
the house is centrally situated with fabulous restaurants nearby."
290001,1825665,2012-07-29,118885,Stephen,"jane was an incredibly gracious and welcoming host, she made me feel right at home after a long flight from the west coast as soon as i arrived at the door.  janes beautiful home (complete with an amazingt collection of art and souvenirs from her many worldwide travels) was the perfect spot for my week in dc. i attended a conference at the convention center a few blocks from jane's home and the location couldn't have been better, a mere 5 minute walk between home and the conference.  tess was a splendid bonus to come home to every evening, greeting me with a quick meow and a purr. the veranda restaurant, literally right around the corner was such a plus too, great food, welcoming staff and a perfect neighborhood spot.  i also really enjoyed the fact that jane's home is in such a very walkable area of dc. i could walk to two excellent grocery stores, lots of good restaurants and cafes along p street and 17th street, all within a 20-30 minute walk of jane's front door. this was my first experience of using airbnb, and i am convinced that from this point on it's the only way to travel. i would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending jane's home to anyone.  "
290001,2227978,2012-09-08,1218392,Ruth,"our visit to washington was particularly good due to jane and her communication with us and also because of her home. being able to have quick responses to emails and queries helps for anxiety free travel and jane was excellent in her communication with us. one of the bonuses one gets by using airbnb.
jane's home was ideal for the two of us - spacious, well furnished and comfortable. as it was particularly hot whilst we were there having air conditioning was a life saver. jane's cat provided the homely feeling for when we returned at the end of the day.
thank you very much jane."
290001,2274495,2012-09-14,2593578,Pierre,"nous sommes 3 amis français partis en voyage cet été sur la côte est des usa, et nous avons résidé pendant plusieurs jours chez jane à washington.
pour la 1ère fois que nous avons utilisé ce mode d'hébergement, nous pouvons vous dire que ce fût une totale réussite ...
la grande gentilesse de jane, le confort et l'équipement très complet de son appartement,  ainsi que l'excellent accueil qu'elle nous a réservé nous autorise à vous la recommander très sincèrement.
sans oublier tess le chat qui apporte une note supplémentaire de bien-être à cette résidence.
si nous retournons à dc, nous n'hésiterons pas une seconde à revenir résider dans ce logement très confortable et bien situé dans un quartier très calme,  mais proche de toute commodités.

merci jane, et à une prochaine fois !

my us/english personal translation (... excuse me for possible translation errors! ) :

we are 3 french friends who went for a trip over the us east coast, and we resided some days at jane's home in washington this summer.
it was the 1st time that we used this type of accomodation, and we can tell you that it was a total success!
jane is a very kind person, his flat is very comfortable and fully equiped ... jane made us a very welcome and we felt like at home.
so we don't hesitate for a second to recommend her home for your next stay in dc !
also, tess the cat brings its particular touch of wellness in this residence.
for a possible come back in dc, it's certain we will be please to stay an other time in this accomodation. this home is located in a very quiet neighborhood, but near from all you need.

thank you jane, and expecting seeing you next time !"
290001,2404852,2012-09-25,1920117,Andreas,"jane is a nice and approachable host, and we had a great time at her house. she had all sorts of brochures available. tess the cat is friendly  and no bother. the house is nice and has lots of character. for the 4 adults in our party it was a bit of a stretch. the second bed is a sofa bed in the office upstairs, with poorly fitting sheets that were not entirely fresh. once you've pulled out the bed, it's impossible to close the door to the room and there is no space left for luggage. otherwise a nice experience in a handy location."
290001,3014425,2012-12-03,582618,Allen,"jane was a fantastic host. her house was great, clean, and in the middle of everything. we would (and hopefully will) rent again.

it's talking distance to almost anything you could want whether you are coming in as a tourist or for business. "
290001,4080883,2013-04-08,660406,Logan,"jane's house feels like home: so warm and inviting! we were so comfortable there among her many books and beautiful things she has collected from all around the world. the bed is quite comfortable, and the steam shower is fabulous. the kitchen is easy to cook in, and whole foods is a short, pleasant walk away on p street. the location couldn't be better, so close to everything, and an easy place from which to navigate. a word of warning for those with cars: be careful not to park on the right-hand side of the street, as it is residential parking only. we got a $30 ticket because we neglected to look at the sign. all around the neighborhood, however, there is ample parking on the left-hand side of the street, which is 2-hr parking, no permits needed. we would highly recommend this sweet, special little house, and hope to be back ourselves one day. thanks you, jane!"
296196,941639,2012-02-22,1431479,Albert,"frank was an exceptional host. his apartment is very conveniently located within walking distance of many restaurants and shops, as well as the national mall and all the monuments. he provided me with a temporary parking pass and i was able to find plenty of parking on the same block. the apartment is clean and complete with everything you may need for having a comfortable stay. i stayed with some friends for a couple of days and we were very impressed with his accommodations and we had a wonderful time. i would definitely stay there again!"
296196,1037398,2012-03-24,1187545,Chad,"great apartment!  clean and well-equipped.  the kitchen had everything i needed to store a few groceries and make breakfast each day.the bed is extremely comfortable, the neighborhood is quiet, and it was easy to walk or bike to everything i was in town for.  

free parking was an amazing bonus, given how expensive nearby hotel parking is.  next time i'm in dc i'll probably rent the same place again."
296196,1042198,2012-03-25,132229,Roxanne,"frank has an amazing place in dc! it is very close to shopping, good food and convenient metro lines. i had no issue when checking in or finding the place; it was all very accommodating. i would highly recommend a stay here if visiting dc. it was a fantastic experience."
296196,1202077,2012-04-30,164973,Patrick,"very welcoming, attractive place to stay, with little extras that made us feel right at home. great neighbourhood, within walking distance of dupont circle, with convenient bus and metro connections to places we wanted to visit. binder of local information as well as guide books were greatly appreciated. we highly recommend frank's home to anyone visiting washington.

296196,1531485,2012-06-21,2577582,Jirek,"everything is clean, very good accomodation and somehow proffesional. quite close to the main attractions in washington. we were there when it was almost hundred degrees f outside and the charming basement is really the best location- no problem to sleep because inside was perfect temperature.

frank is a gentleman and an excellent host. i hope to return to this dupont english basement soon."
296196,1775572,2012-07-23,2266092,Richard,"this was my first experience with an airbnb stay, and it was excellent. the apartment is located a few blocks from dupont circle eateries and a great gym, a short cab ride (less than $10) to sightseeing destinations and shopping in georgetown, but at the same time is quiet. so nice not to be in a busy hotel! frank was very helpful leading up to and during our stay, with suggestions and recommendations. super comfortable bed. clean and well maintained and air conditioned apartment. providing coffee and tea was greatly apprecated too. i'd definately stay here again. thank you frank. "
296196,2031840,2012-08-19,3047460,Laetitia,"we stayed at frank's with my husband and three-year old boy and we had a wonderful time. frank's space is very nice, well decorated, quiet and functional. we enjoyed the little basket with coffee and teas for our breakfast. it was very convenient to have a washer-dryer. 

the neighborhood was very calm and safe and we were able to park our rental car easily; frank was very nice and left us a parking pass.

i would definitely stay there again!"
296196,2109716,2012-08-27,2859546,Michelle,"the apartment was more than we expected. great location (we walked home each night, didn't even use public transportation it was so close), very clean upon arrival, and it gave us the feeling of being in our own apartment since we had a kitchen to cook and a laundry area to wash clothes. frank was very helpful with the check-in process (this was our first time using airbnb), and he answered his phone when i had questions. if i ever head back to dc i will definitely try to stay here again. thank you!"
296196,2578786,2012-10-11,2968849,Sharron Ann,frank is a great host and the apartment is absolutely perfect for a visit to dc. the apartment is exactly as advertised and very comfortable. great location and safe neighborhood. we enjoyed our stay in dc immensely.
296196,2653656,2012-10-19,2416626,Peter,"great apartment in a  lovely locality and easy walking distance to the metro, bars and cafes. frank has a folder of helpful tourist info available . the apartment is spacious with cooking facilities if needed. very comfortable."
296196,6439403,2013-08-12,5366759,Anjani,"frank's apartment was in a great location and was very comfortable. everything was clean and the kitchen was great and usable for cooking meals! frank was also extremely responsive throughout our stay and immediately helped us whenever we had an issue. when we thought the air conditioning wasn't working, he quickly came over to fix it and left us a fan just in case we needed more cool air! he was so helpful and we had a great stay!"
296196,7032486,2013-09-04,1143024,Marine,"l'appartement est super, il est confortable et propre. frank laisse à disposition des informations très utiles sur le quartier, les restaurants, les supermarchés, ainsi que des guides. il y a tout ce qu'il faut pour se faire à manger. frank a répondu très rapidement à nos demandes. le seul problème pour nous a été qu' il y a beaucoup de moustiques à washington (pas étonnant en août). nous sommes très contents de notre séjour et de l'appartement, je le recommande sans hésiter!"
296196,9301867,2013-12-19,2093262,Katie,great place with everything you could need - frank was always responsive and the location was perfect for going out to dinner or drinks.
299030,1255545,2012-05-09,307975,Alda & Jim,"i wanted to thank donna for being so friendly and for all of her hospitality.  i was coming from out of town and totally unfamiliar with the area.  i had an early monday morning appointment and donna took the time to point out where the closest bus stop and metro stations were so i knew where i was going in the morning.  i really appreciate how she went out of her way to make sure i knew how to find my way around the area.  the house is in a quiet neighborhood, close to public transportation and i enjoyed my stay.  thank you for everything.  "

299030,1367798,2012-05-28,2406459,Veena,"our stay at donna's home was enjoyable n unforgettable..donna n her son were perfect hosts..their lil pup diesel was also very kind..our daughter had a very nice time with him! good n healthy breakfast, easy transport, feel-free home all makes donna's place a happy n right place to stay. c u soon donna next time!"
299030,1513070,2012-06-18,2652804,Andrew,"my wife and i were passing through the city on out way to northwest connecticut by car, from texas via florida, and we had gotten pretty tired of sleeping in the car so we started looking for a place to stay. the night before my sister told me about the airbnb service and we thought to give it a try. this was our first find and it was something! donna was a delight to chat with. the work she does and the places she's seen make for some interesting stories. her sons are friendly too and helped make the place feel like home we had been staying in for a while, not just one day; it hardly felt like a bed n' breakfast. my only regret is that we had to leave so soon."
299030,1701301,2012-07-13,1233299,Shauna,donna lewis is a spectacular host!  she is very pleasant and accommodating. beautiful home.  i would love to stay at her place when i return to the city.  
299030,1737391,2012-07-17,1299819,Anna,"donna and her family are amazing! she graciously gave my sister and i a last minute booking, and welcomed us with kindness. her home is very clean and comfortable. she is the perfect airbnb host!"
299030,1815249,2012-07-27,1299819,Anna,awesome! donna is very accommodating and respectful-the perfect host!
299030,1944312,2012-08-10,1299819,Anna,"donna and her family provided my sister and i with a welcoming, safe, clean, and very comfortable place to stay. we felt so at home that it was like staying with family. we're so thankful for them!"
299030,2014716,2012-08-17,1299819,Anna,"donna and her sons are the best! my sister and i loved our stay with the lewis family, and cannot thank them enough for their kindness and generosity. our time with them happened was exactly what we needed!"
299030,2212009,2012-09-05,2953359,Shauna Jonvieve,"donna is a wonderful host, she has a beautiful home in a very nice neighborhood and in a very convenient location."
299030,2632997,2012-10-16,3391553,Michaela,"donna was really nice hostess, very helpful and friendly. room was ok. and donna´s breakfast was the biggest surprise of our short stay. reeeally tasty. :-)"
299030,5184610,2013-06-17,5831476,Georg,"i had a wonderful stay at donna's house. she and her family really make you feel welcome. i can only recommend her place if you plan a short-term or long-term stay in dc. the room is very spacious and the location with the bus stop around the corner to go downtown, and the metro close by is brilliant. "
303694,994544,2012-03-13,1890355,Alex,"this place is great.  it is clean, orderly, and quiet.  the overall design of the place shows that a lot of thought was put into anticipating what would be convenient for the guest, with nooks for storage and easy access to cooking and cleaning equipment.  also, as the title suggests, the place is quite spacious.  nick and lylie are also wonderful hosts; very friendly and quite accommodating

i highly recommend this place for the dc passerby or those that are looking for a clean, quiet launch pad into the dc housing scene!"
303694,1032460,2012-03-22,1877032,June,"the was my fourth stay with nick and lylie and once again i was thoroughly impressed.  these hosts have created the ultimate washington dc bed and breakfast experience.  now they are using airbnb i liked seeing the photos and found the reservation system very straight forward.

highlights for me include:
this truly is a private guest retreat and such an oasis.  lylie and nick are very welcoming, i do appreciate that the guest suite is separate from their house, its nice to feel independent, yet have the hosts on hand for questions etc.

every detail is carefully prepared: delicious breakfast items, the kitchenette set up really is amazing and ideal for me so i could prepare a lunch to go for the day.  a  few nights i picked up items at the local yes organic and made a simple meal. 
the bed is very comfortable and for my longer stays i like that i can get all my things out of the suitcase and hang or have organized on shelves.

this is why i keep coming back, they have the guests needs always in mind.  finally as i use public transport it's convenient that there are bus stops and a metro station so close.  even when i caught a taxi home in the evening, the cost was very affordable.

thanks nick and lylie for your hospitality.

303694,1045473,2012-03-26,1141828,Rachel,"my husband and i had an absolutely wonderful time staying in this beautiful and comfortable suite. nick and lylie are very friendly and welcoming. they clearly have a passion for hospitality and offering a beautiful space to travelers, and offer great suggestions for local eats and attractions. this suite is full of the details that make a place wonderful to stay -  maps,  guidebooks, dvd collection, adorable decor, convenient kitchen goods, and plush linens. 

it's by far the nicest place we've ever stayed on airbnb, and also happens to be in a fantastic location for exploring washington dc. we appreciated being able to eat breakfast at the little breakfast table, going off to explore the city, and coming back to lounge and relax. our trip happened to be during the 100th anniversary of the cherry blossom festival, but we fell in love with dc, so now we just have to come back again soon to do all kinds of other fun things next time!"
303694,1073754,2012-04-02,1378240,Lennox,"nick and lylie are gracious host and hostess.  the accommondations are both spacious and modern.  usually in bnbs there are a few things missing that you would like to have; not in this case.  nick and lylie have thought of everything.  with a private entrance and coded access, it was easy to come and go as my schedule permitted.  the bus to the metro was one block away.  the return bus stops running around 7pm but there is another that stops four blocks away.  the flat had a complete set of bus and metro schedules making it easy to plan.  the flat was spotless.  a living area, kitchette area, full bath and bedroom made for a very comfotable stay."
303694,1208528,2012-05-01,764716,Leena,"nick and lylie's place was perfect for my long-term stay (i was there for a month).  it's not close to the city center, but there are very convenient bus lines nearby and the georgia ave/petworth metro station is a 10 minute walk away.  both nick and lylie were great hosts and lylie was even nice enough to drive me to the local organic grocery store when i first arrived. 

the place itself is clean, spacious, and modern.  "
303694,1223580,2012-05-03,738676,Jack,"a great place - a private, roomy, and quiet one-bedroom with a very comfortable bed, delicious breakfast, and  all the amenities. nick and lylie were friendly and very helpful, with a dinner recommendation (the meal at chez billy was superb), getting around (our schedules matched up so lylie drove me to chez billy and i went with them to the metro), etc! "
303694,1229838,2012-05-05,1543446,Denise,"this suite was the perfect place for me and my husband while exploring washington, dc.  lyle is a fabulous, friendly and communicative host. she put a lot of effort into making us feel at home in washington, d.c.  the suite has a totally independent entrance, very clean, safe and beautiful place.  georgia avenue-petworth metro station is about ten minutes walking distance but lyle graciously on two separate occasions was available to take us to the metro station in order to get to our tours on time.  asian food in “sala thai restaurant & sushi bar” was delicious.  thank you nick & lyle for your warmth & hospitality.  we definitely recommend the suite and already are planning our second visit.
"
303694,1355564,2012-05-27,1695263,Shirley,"our hosts were wonderfull!!  the suite was perfect for us.    our hosts were extremely helpful and friendly and took care of all of our requests for help  and  met our needs.   we stayed two weeks and made ourselves to home.  we felt like we were staying with family, lylie and nick were available for assistance and responded immediately for help and directions, and everything we needed. 

we did not have a car so did all our traveling on bus and metro.  the bus stop was barely a 1/2 block away which took us to the metro ( we are senior citizens and wanted to save our walking for the museums and sights).  the bus ride was about 10 minutes to the metro which took us any where we wanted to go in about 20 minutes.  our hosts had maps and schedules and guide books available for us which were extremely helpful.   you must go to lincoln's cottage which is just up the street from suite.  it was something we would not have known about if it wasn't for lylie telling us about it. 

the suite was extremely clean and  very comfortable. having access to laundry facilities , right in our suite, to use whenever we  required  was an extra plus.

the neighborhood was safe and the people were friendly and helpful.  some even drove us to the metro when we were waiting for the bus.  the bus drivers were always helpful in calling out our destination for us.
everyone we met was helpful and friendly. 

we would definately recommend   lylie and nick and there comfortable suite.

303694,1425962,2012-06-06,2090828,Randy And Annette,"lylie made us feel right at home from the start.  and the accommodations exceeded our expectations for roominess (fit our family of four just fine), cleanliness, and provisions (lylie knew just when we were about to run out of breakfast supplies and replenished them with all we wanted).  we had a very active vacation so most often arrived home after dark.  after the first couple nights we felt most comfortable taking the bus from the metro, and using the maps provided by our hosts, we figured out how to get dropped off within a couple blocks of home."
303694,1442483,2012-06-09,2188965,John And Sue,"the bnb was wonderful - clean and comfortable.  we feel like nick and lylie thought of everything we would need to make our stay pleasant. we also appreciated our hosts accommodating our 11-year-old daughter. we loved being able to take advantage of the bus - the nearest stop was a quick walk from the bnb, and the bus dropped us off and picked us up right at the national mall, saving us tons in money and in effort to find a parking space.  "
303694,1505067,2012-06-18,2280486,Thom,"i had a truly wonderful 10 days staying at nick & lylie's gorgeous little home-from-home.

the area is welcoming and vibrant, and lylie gave great advice on local amenities and travel tips. 

although i ostensibly came for work (a conference), i'm so glad that i allowed a couple of extra days to get to know the area. 

if you are looking for a base to explore the city, or from which to work, then i honestly cannot imagine why anyone would even think about looking elsewhere.

on a side note, be sure to check out the two bars wonderland ballroom (in columbia heights), and the looking glass lounge (near georgia avenue petworth metro). one word of warning, though: be careful when going to wonderland for brunch. you may not leave 'til the dance floor closes...

thank you for all your hard work, lylie!"
303694,1528685,2012-06-21,2070594,Ari,very cozy place and friendly hosts. it was really clean and well equipped. lylie and nick had good folder full of ideas what to do and where to eat nearby.  we enjoyed this bnb and would stay again. 
303694,1564857,2012-06-26,1833414,Sarah,"nick and lylie were fantastic hosts and made this bnb feel like my own little aparment away from home!  i would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay!  both nick and lylie were extremely helpful with figuring out transportation, and lylie even came to the rescue when my friend, who was meeting me there, got stranded in a hurricane like rain!  in addition, nick and lylie have great resources put together for their guests with information on food, things to do, and transportation!  "
303694,1579949,2012-06-28,2158601,Mark,"the suite sits underneath the main suite of the property, and is almost completely self contained. it was all very neat and tidy, the bed was comfy, wifi internet worked seamlessly and access to the washer and dryer was an added plus.

there is no tv network access, but there is a dvd player and film collection, in which i had no problems finding a couple of good flicks. the provided breakfast was minimal, but i appreciated it.

lylie was able to walk me through access to the propey when i arrived through sms, and then came down to check all was okay when she got home. she also kindly offered me a trip to the subway station the morning i left.

the suite is a fair way from downtown, but is only a ten minute walk from a metro station. i found the metro system to be reliable and timely, and didn't feel unsafe walking the streets (at daytime and dusk).

all in all, the room was excellent, and i was made to feel at hone. i'd stay here again without a second thought."
303694,1847569,2012-07-31,2083031,Robert,"the suite is larger than it seems in the pictures; and after being there, it could easily accommodate three or four on a short stay. having the washer/dryer in the space is a luxury. the refrigerator was sufficient for our needs. no kitchen sink; but if you don't mind washing dishes while you shower like we didn't, you won't have a problem. no thermostat in the unit, but the home is kept at a comfortable, cool temperature. the suite is clean, cozy, spacious, and welcoming. all of the necessary amenities and more are included in the kitchen (coffee, cereal, snacks, wine opener, dishes, food containers for leftovers, even chopsticks!). in the month we were there, it really did become a home away from home.
 
nick and lylie are fun, vibrant people and responsive hosts; they've prepared an itinerary booklet with hotspots in all genres and arenas of interests; this led us to find some places we otherwise would have missed. they also have various maps and guidebooks (and games, and a helping of dvd movies) in the suite for your reference and are always available with excellent restaurant and entertainment suggestions if you ask. 

they gave us rides to the metro a few times, helped us with our bikes, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. we would definitely consider staying with them again and highly recommend their suite to others.

petworth and the areas just west are of great recent history. the area has become more infused with different ethnicities and spread along stratification lines; but if i never hear the word ""gentrification"" again, i will be just fine. there are fun, urbane, hip bars and eateries within walking distance. a gardener's market type place, ""yes!"", is maybe four blocks away. the capitol is a good 5 miles from your stoop, seems like more on bike because of hills. 

walk to metro is about 10 minutes. buses come more often and ride straight down 7th street into the capitol. there's also a cvs right by the metro that is convenient. it was great getting to know an area of dc that isn't swarming with tourists but still has character and style.

303694,1975904,2012-08-13,3151334,Rina,"wow what a great place. they had everything you could ask for - extra blankets, dvds, games, food, umbrellas, and even a grill if you wanted! i forgot a dress there on a hanger, and they were very accommodating so i could get it back. overall, it was a very clean, spacious (we had four people and all comfortably stayed here), and convenient place to stay. "
303694,2000519,2012-08-16,2467629,Anne-Laure,"nick and lylie are wonderful guests who took excellent care of us. the suite is perfect and clean, breakfast a real plus when you are staying only 3 days. lylie took the time to give us many tips regarding transports, restaurants or museums !"
303694,2027316,2012-08-19,2475926,Michelle,"we really enjoyed our stay in nick and lylie's house and wish we could've stayed longer. we stayed for only two nights and had the chance to talk with lylie, who was very kind and helpful. she even drove us to the metro entrance the first night and recommended a place for dinner nearby. the place was very spacious, as advertised, and the hosts provided milk, cereal, tea, and juice for breakfast. it was a short walk to the metro and a short metro ride to the mall, where we spent the one day we had in dc. i highly recommend this place for a couple or small group of people visiting dc."
303694,2141090,2012-08-30,2542728,Annika,nick's and lylie's place is a really great option when you want to visit dc. especially the washing machine and the dryer comes in handy. nick and lylie are really helpful and answer you any question concerning dc. 
303694,2295066,2012-09-14,3194321,Sue,"modern and clean. a home away from home. excellent host and provided  good advice about the area and other regions nearby.

highly recommend this place to stay!"

the neighborhood is lovely and residential, and street parking was convenient. lylie offered great cheer, and useful insider advice about transportation, activities, and neighborhood resources. an informative collection of printed dc map, entertainment, menus, etc. materials were readily available in the apartment. totally worth a stay. ;-)"
303694,2610670,2012-10-15,2166633,Christophe,"i had a wonderful time staying at the suite of nick and lylie. when i arrived i got a very nice welcome and got all details about my suite and dc. lylie shared much helpful information about getting around. i was in dc for a course in silver spring and this suite was the perfect home base. i got in the center of dc in 15 to 20 minutes. 
the neighbourhood is very quite and relaxing and it is not too far from the beautiful park rock creek. the metro is nearby and takes you into the city. my hosts were enormously kind to me; better than i could have imagined. this place is the best you can get in dc.

thanks again, 

christophe"
303694,2672617,2012-10-21,2441213,Josh,great place. great hosts.  
303694,2706455,2012-10-24,3783613,Katie,this was a lovely get away after 8 hours of training. lylie was more than willing to do anything she could to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. we felt very fortunate to have stumbled upon this refuge in the city. i would highly recommend staying in this suit! nick and lylie are wonderful hosts!
303694,2770025,2012-10-31,3596696,Nicole,"d'habitude je n'aime pas faire de commentaire ou donner mon avis sur les prestations que je reçois cependant cette fois je ne peux pas me taire.
l’appartement de  lylie est propre, spacieux, neuf. c'est digne d'un hôtel 4 étoile. je dirai même que les photos ne rendent pas bien la beauté de l’appartement qui peut héberger 4 personnes. lylie est une hôte géniale, disponible , serviable , compréhensive....nous étions avec mon amie edwige dans l'appartement quand l’ouragan sandy a frappé.pour nous des étrangers dans une ville où nous venions d'arriver c’était la catastrophe. lylie nous a pris sous son aile en nous donnant toutes les informations et précautions à prendre pour affronter sandy. elle nous a même invité chez elle et donné à manger pendant tous les temps où nous étions bloquées car nous n'avions pas eu le temps de nous approvisionner.  je recommande à 200% cette appartement et chaque fois que j'irai à washington je passerai un coup à lylie pour voir si son appartement est libre. merci lylie

lylie in english for you
the apartment recently renovated is clean and spacious . it's worthy of a 4 star hotel. for me the pictures on airbnb don't show the beauty of lylie's accommodation. the apartment can receive 4 persons.
 lylie is a great host, available, helpful and comprehensive . she provided milk, cereal, tea, and juice for breakfast. we were with my friend edwige  when hurricane sandy struck. for us, foreigners in new city , it was a disaster.
 lylie helped us by giving us all the information and precautions to take . she invited us to her home and gave us foods because we didn't have time to supply. i recommend this apartment and every time i go to washington i will call lylie to see if its apartment is free. 
thank you so much lylie

303694,2826257,2012-11-07,3636446,Maria,"i stayed there for the weekend and really enjoyed my time there! lylie is a perfect host, she even brought some food for us since that we haven't had a chance to have a dinner before our late arrival. the apartment is just as perfect as in photos and very comfortable. the neighbrhood is quiet and cozy, metro if just 10min by walk and easily get to the center city.

lylie, thank you for hosting! all the best to you! "
303694,3319097,2013-01-09,3859618,Jenny,"nick and lylie were super nice and accommodating. i loved the cozy interior of the basement suite, and everything seemed really new and clean. i especially enjoyed the selection of teas, coffee, and cereal. there is no kitchen sink, so cooking isn't really an option. but there is a microwave and plenty of other kitchen appliances, tools/silverware that will suffice for grabbing a quick breakfast or heating up some food. i would highly recommend this place."
303694,3349715,2013-01-14,2381854,Whitley,"i booked nick & lylie's place for my mother and sister who came to dc to visit a sick relative at the va hospital. even though i gave them only a day's notice, nick & lylie were very responsive and welcoming. they were very communicative hosts and helped my family feel comfortable, especially during a such difficult journey. the apartment was clean, accommodating, affordable, and adorably decorated. whenever my family comes to dc- hopefully for a happier occasion next time- we are staying with nick & lylie!  "
303694,3400290,2013-01-23,4141583,Jasmin,"3 friends and i stayed with nick & lylie during inauguration weekend and had the best experience!  the apartment is so cute, comfortable and clean.  all the extra little details they put into our stay really made the difference!  the apartment is in a convenient location close to public transportation and restaurants, but far enough away for quiet nights and most importantly, parking!  i would highly recommend staying with nick & lylie on your next trip to dc--i'll definitely be back!"
303694,3574990,2013-02-18,3406008,Jon,"the unit was exactly as described, very clean, an cozy.  perfect for our stay.  5 minute walk to the metro and lots of nice places in the area within walking distance.  would definitely stay again."

"
303694,4064707,2013-04-07,861174,Heather,"although we did not have an opportunity to meet nick and lylie, i can tell you that they are excellent hosts who really take the time to consider even the smallest details for their guests.

my boyfriend and i stayed three nights at their bnb and it was simply perfect. thanks nick and lylie for being so accommodating, especially with our arrival schedule."
303694,4136461,2013-04-13,4629859,Sonja,lylie and nick offer a very very lovely suite. we enjoyed our stay very much. special thanks to lylie for helping us with directions as we were travelling without gps system!!

303694,4292245,2013-04-25,4538049,Constantin,nick and lylie have been great hosts to a great apartment that lacked no comfort. we had a comfortable stay and would recommend staying at nick and lylie's apartment anytime! we even got breakfast and medical advice when needed!
303694,4374800,2013-05-01,233631,Sandra,"nick and lylie's place was just as advertised.  cozy and warm.  conveniently located and within easy walking distance to the station.  beds were comfortable, the accommodations were clean, snacks, breakfast cereals and fresh soy milk was available upon arrival.  this place more than delivered and we would definitely stay here again.  look no further than nick and lylie's if you're wanting a place to rest and relax in dc!"

303694,4661850,2013-05-19,1573423,Zarona & Volker,"lylie and nick went out of their way to accommodate our request to see the suite before we rented it for our friends. the suite is clean, cozy and comfortably hosts a family of three. lylie and nick are very thoughtful hosts, not only they have things for guests for breakfast but they also left two smart-trip cards – a very nice touch! we will definitely recommend their suite to our future guests. "
303694,4755496,2013-05-24,4876028,Jana,"we stayed at nick and lylie's for three nights in may. it was our first airbnb experience and we were so impressed with the apartment as well as their hospitality. we arrived late at night due to flight delays and lylie still came out to explain everything to us, including handy tips on transport, places to eat etc. the apartment is small but had everything we needed and we felt very at home. it was nice to have breakfast things, washer and dryer, clean towels and amenities. it was an easy walk to the bus stop and metro station, although at night  we felt safer catching taxi/bus back instead of walking from the metro (a 10-15min walk, but the bus stop is just a few minutes).  we like to be extra cautious at night, but the area is a safe one. thank you nick and lylie for making our stay a wonderful one! we will be back if we visit in the future."
303694,4806336,2013-05-27,5753945,Nicole,nick and lylie are awesome hosts. the appartment is beautiful and very comfortable. we were allowed to use the washing mashine and the dryer and everything worked very easy and fast. lylie had some good tipps for shopping or dinning. both were very kind and we would like to come back once. as an airbnb we can totally recommend this place.
303694,5008589,2013-06-07,6138250,Rachel,"nick and lylie's was our first airbnb experience. that being said i will definitely use airbnb again. we arrived late and lylie with a big smile came out to meet us, showing us around her place and helping us get familiar with our living space for the week. it was clean and spacious. just right for our little family.

she has put together a wonderful little book with great recommendations on where to eat and directions to each place, metro passes, and maps of all the local touristy stuff for her guests. the fridge was stocked with milk and juice, there was cereal and coffee ready to go as well. all making it very easy to get up and go in the mornings armed with caffeine and information.

we took many a long walk in the surrounding neighborhoods and felt safe the entire time, since i had my 6 year old with us this was important. the neighbors were friendly and so were the lightning bugs that accompanied us in the evenings.

if you're looking for a place to stay comfortably, with friendly hosts willing to answer questions and genuinely enjoy having guests than i would recommend nick and lylie. you'll feel welcome here and for a party of 3 (maybe 4) this is the perfect place to stay."
303694,5061011,2013-06-10,101547,Yng-Ru,"we stayed two nights here and had a very positive experience. lylie was gracious and greeted us upon arrival, which was helpful because we accidentally pulled into the wrong street. our family (two small kids and two adults) fit comfortably and had no issues at all. we drove and used public transportation; parking on the street was easy, and the walk to the metro was fine as well (we are used to walks being from nyc). highly recommended."
303694,5414591,2013-06-29,6364531,Ann,"the preceding reviews, taken together, cover all the bases, to which i'll add: 

1) n+l's is the most comprehensive airbnb listing i've ever seen; you really know what to expect, no surprises. plus their listing provides lots of ideas & tips for pre-planning your trip. 

2) n+l go beyond basic provisioning, with unexpected conveniences, e.g., an endless supply of filtered drinking-water was very welcome indeed! 

i'd be pleased to stay again. ann."
303694,6190500,2013-08-03,5519705,Robert,"i spent five weeks in d.c. undertaking a course in georgetown university, along with a friend. nick and lylie were fantastic hosts: warm, welcoming and friendly, but at the same time they were not overbearing and gave us plenty of space.

i was a little nervous before arriving, as it was my first time using airbnb, and, with the exception of a visit to see disneyland aged 8, my first time in the usa. i arrived in washington on july 4th, a day ahead of my friend, and without knowing anyone in the city. nick and lylie took me under their wing and brought me down to a local firework viewing party and introduced me to some of their neighbours. thanks to my wonderful hosts, i thoroughly enjoyed my first independence day and made some good friends!

the place was comfortable, clean and spacious. i stayed in the main bedroom, which was very pleasant, and my friend (as the late arrival) occupied the sofa bed. the only negative thing i have to say about nick and lylie's place is that the lack of a full kitchen in the basement apartment began to be a bit of a nuisance after the first couple of weeks - dishes needed to be washed in a basin in the bathroom, and our diets were a little bit restricted!

petworth is a great neighbourhood, and i would recommend nick and lylie's place to anyone visiting d.c.! last, but not least, make sure you check out red derby, the brilliant neighbourhood bar! "
303694,6755655,2013-08-24,1670899,Mary Kay And Lou,"we loved staying at lylie and nick's! it was very comfortable with many extras. they truly have a real bed with box springs and a mattress plus the most comfortable sheets i have ever encountered which made every night a good night's sleep. there was filtered water available all the time as well as cereals,candy, teas, juice, and coffee. there was a variety of d.v.d.s, games, magazines , and books to choose from and lot's of info. on the neighborhood and travel in d.c. they provide 2 smart cards for using public transportation which adds up in savings. the apartment is just as nice as it looks in the photos and nick and lylie couldn't have been better hosts. a delightful stay.
mary kay and lou"
303694,7761661,2013-10-01,2506329,Edward,this basement apartment was very comfortable to stay in. everything was as promised when we arrived. nick and lyle provided a very clean well-kept space that we were happy to find after a nine hour trip. the bed was very comfortable. there is room to sit in the living room comfortably. we are pretty independent travelers and saw nick and lyle only briefly and spent time in the apartment only to sleep and prepare for the day. they communicated with us throughout the visit via phone and text about various logistics. we did sleep late the first night because it was darker in the basement than we predicted. that meant we had a great night's sleep were both well rested for the day. 
303694,7796708,2013-10-03,5016304,Christian,"we really enjoyed our stay in nick and lylies apartment.
when we checked in, we could do it on our own as no keys were needed, very easy and convenient.
the beds were very spacious and comfortable; cereals, milk, tea and coffee were provided; we could use the washer, which was quite useful after the first 8 days in ny. a very nice fact is also that nick and lylie provide smarttrip-cards, due to that you don't have to pay that much for the metro-fares.

thanks for the nice airbnb!
"
303694,7948636,2013-10-09,1458606,John,"we had a wonderful time staying at nick and lylie's basement apartment last weekend.
all communication prior to the trip was prompt and clear, and everything went smoothly with our arrival into the apartment. once inside we found everything to be just as depicted, clean and comfortable and welcoming.
they have a small library of magazines and guides to dc on hand, and they were most gracious in offering personal advice on places to visit.
we were visiting during the government shutdown, and they were most informative on places that were still open to the public.
their apartment is just a five minute walk away from lincoln's cottage, which is perched on a high point overlooking the city, a place he frequented often during the hot summers of his presidency. definitely worth a visit.
i hope to return to dc in the near future and will definitely look to stay with them again.

"
303694,8194844,2013-10-20,8848425,Lindiwe,highly suggest the selection of this location!  nick and lylie are great hosts.  i think they have truly thought of everything you could need while away from your home.  i just hope their place is available on my next trip to dc.
303694,8995094,2013-12-01,9039811,Jim,"nick and lylie are perfect hosts!  i stayed in the suite for just over 30 days while looking for a permanent place in dc.  during that time they made me feel welcome while respecting my privacy.  the time in the suite was comfortable and i would stay here again.

the suite is private.  i never once saw them in the suite while i was there.  they were extremely careful to coordinate the times they needed to access the space so that it seemed like an apartment.

the location is perfect.  you will be 13 minutes by foot to the petworth metro.  this metro is great because it small and easy to understand for someone just learning the system.  from this location you can be at the national mall in 15 minutes.  there are two stops on this line that will take you a block north or south of the mall.  

petworth is a relatively safe neighborhood in dc.  crime in this area is lower than many other places in the district.  this is not to say it's crime free and you should always be aware of your surroundings but i walked at night alone to and from the station and never felt at risk.  it is generally a quiet neighborhood.

the suite has a microwave, tv, mini fridge, private bath, and a very comfortable.  they kept disposable dishes and utensils available which eliminates  the need for a kitchen sink.

highly recommend staying with nick and lylie.  they thought of everything all the way down to snacks, breakfast food, coffee, hot tea, a book with directions and tips, and they made accessing the suite very secure but very easy.  book it now while it is available!"
305783,6153872,2013-08-01,6779270,James,i had a great stay with neida! she was very welcoming and had great communication with me leading up to my 1st day in the apartment. it is a gated community and very close to the freeway and public transportation. the place was very nice and clean and has all the amenities you will need to have a comfortable stay in dc. 
306465,1000733,2012-03-14,1526940,Chris,"great part of town, great apartment, clean and dana was very welcoming. would consider staying here again if visiting washington dc."

313405,1449811,2012-06-10,2313527,Tod,"donna was a fantastic host and incredibly accommodating. she and her two sons (lance and christopher) are helpful and friendly, and provided me with a wonderful place to stay as i got situated in the city. i enjoyed my time with them, and plan on keeping in touch with this wonderful woman."
313405,1879476,2012-08-03,1299819,Anna,staying with donna and her sons has made my transition to washington dc 1000 times better since my arrival. their home is a wonderful space that makes you feel very welcome while respecting privacy. i can't recommend them more highly.
313405,2291725,2012-09-14,689637,Ilya,"donna is a great hostess. the room was clean and big, with a mini fridge and a desk and a private bathroom and everything i needed. it's a quiet neighborhood and the walk to the nearest metro is 15-20 mins. everything as advertised. i'd highly recommend it!"
313405,3049432,2012-12-09,3582431,Greg,my daughter stayed almost 2 months with donna and had a grand and productive time  in dc.
315140,1176960,2012-04-25,193701,Robin,"this is a fantastic place; i stayed for almost two months and found it the perfect base of operations for dc. you should know that the area just outside your front door here is quite hectic. but if you're ready for it, the location is perfect: it's a quick walk down to the mall, and you're literally on top of a metro stop.

don't miss chinatown coffee, just two blocks away—the perfect place to grab a coffee, get on the internet & either work away or plan your day in dc."
315140,1309917,2012-05-20,1627262,Carolyn,"the penn quarter studio is both delightful and very well located. literally steps from the cinatown/gallery place  metro, the ninth floor apartment is exceptionally clean, quiet, and well-appointed.  tolu is also an excellent and attentive host. i look forward to returning here in the future. "
315140,1834464,2012-07-30,1978990,Emerson,"this apartment is incredible, and tolu is a wonderful host. you are right over top of a metro and tons of restaurants, and within a ten minute walk of the national mall and the white house. i was six blocks away from work and couldn't have asked for a better experience. the space is beautiful and well-furnished, and the noise of everything around you doesn't intrude because the unit faces inward. the unit also has access to a great lounge, balcony, and gym. when any minimal problems arose, tolu was very responsive and helpful.

when i first came across the listing, i thought it was too good to be true. turns out it just is that good. do yourself a favor and stay here; it won't get any better in dc."
315140,2669596,2012-10-21,615629,Gemma,"the apartment was great, just as pictured and had everything that i needed. the building itself was lovely and even had a gym and weekly yoga classes that i attended. 

the location was perfect for transport right by the metro and bus stops, but to be honest i hardly used them because most things (shops, museums, galleries, theater etc) were within walking distance.

tolu was always easy to contact and very helpful, i would definitely recommend this place to others."
316270,1038130,2012-03-24,59722,Kara,"jen and john were great hosts. the place was extremely clean and almost felt like a hotel (actually even better than a hotel!). they provided coffee, tea, oranges and snacks in the kitchen and toiletries in the bathroom. would definitely stay here again next time i'm in d.c"
316270,1059191,2012-03-29,1927662,Dillon,"jen and john were wonderful hosts. they were always available, but respectful of our privacy.  notably, jen was so very gracious and adaptable when a booking error occurred on our end. as for the space, the apartment was comfortable and clean. jen and john kindly supplied nice little extras like tea, fruits, yogurts, and granola bars. the location of the apartment is ideal - just a lovely, but short walk to the george ave./petworth metro station. 

very highly recommended. "

316270,1128540,2012-04-14,1991638,Lisa,"john and jen were great!  the apartment was exactly like the pictures and very clean. the kitchen is fantastic - has a great fridge, stove and microwave.  we were able to save a great deal of money by cooking for breakfasts and dinners.  jen was very generous and loaned us her own pan for pancakes and eggs.   the place was great for our family of four with the bedroom for the kids and the crate and barrel pull-out for us.   and, the washer /dryer on site meant bringing home clean clothes.   jen and john were also available for information (gave us directions to the grocery store and more!).  location is perfect - a short walk to the metro station and the neighborhood grocer.  the neighbors were even helpful and friendly - great area.  would definitely look to stay again if we return to dc!  "
316270,1155708,2012-04-20,489120,David,"the apartment is modern, clean and well maintained.  just take into account that it is located in the basement so don't expect any sun light or fresh air. regarding location - it's quite close to the subway and some bus stops so commuting to the main touristic attractions is easy and takes about 15 minutes . the hosts were nice, left us a key so we were able to check in after midnight. they also left milk, cake and some snacks."
316270,1205746,2012-04-30,1666374,Christlie Denise,"jen was extremely helpful and gave us our space. very quick reply!!!! my friend and i drove from ny to dc to go apartment shopping and jen opened up her home to us fairly quickly. she was there to let us in and allowed us to check in early. unfortunately, we did not read over the check out time and we stayed another hour. but she was very understanding. 

i highly recommend her home. the kitchen was modern and looked amazing. there is a great private entrance and a place to do laundry."
316270,1258331,2012-05-10,419177,Howard,had a grate stay and was close to the metro which is great in dc. parking was no problem and jen was always available for answers. would stay there again. coffee was ready to make when i arrived late. maps and info was in the unit ready to use.

316270,1427646,2012-06-06,2312209,Mylène,we had a wonderful experience at jen's apartment. the neighborhood is very quiet and friendly and the metro is only a few blocks away. there is also an organic market near the apartment where you can buy groceries. jen was very helpful and respectful of our privacy. i would stay there again.
316270,1440538,2012-06-08,380707,Joshua,"apartment was as advertised. about a 5 minute walk from the metro and clean.  i was only there to sleep, but stopped in to talk to jen for a bit. she was friendly and informational."
316270,1449199,2012-06-10,2256526,Kathi,"this was a very nice apartment, exactly as pictured in ad. clean and comfortable. convenient to metro and some local shops. the neighborhood felt safe and friendly."

316270,2108215,2012-08-27,2596187,Veronique,"we spend 2 nights in the appartment with our 3 teenagers. the appartment was great, a bit dark because it is located in the basement but it offers all the necessary facilities. jen and her husband were always available to help and answer all our  questions. the location is very close to the metro so very convenient to go in the city center. no problem as well to park the car in the street. i will recommend this place to my friends who want to visit washinston. "
316270,2336502,2012-09-18,3078561,Kyle,"highly recommended!!! this was a perfect place to stay while visiting the downtown dc area. metro is very close, as is an organic grocery store and cvs pharmacy. just a short trip on the metro and you are right downtown.  the unit was a great size (held 4 of us) and had everything we needed and more! jen was an awesome host and made sure to keep in contact and provide anything we needed. thanks so much for helping us make our trip even more memorable!"
316270,2374171,2012-09-22,3201812,Rebecca,we had a great stay here. the hosts have really thought of everything. we would stay here again and will definitely recommend it to friends.
316270,2625580,2012-10-15,3697347,Tshidi,"i enjoyed staying at jen's: it was comfortable, clean, and central. she was a great host and i'd definitely stay at the apartment again. i really liked the neighbourhood; there seemed to be a great sense of community. i remember coming home one day to the kids on the street sweeping up leaves on the pavement; the childish laughter and parents catching up made it really welcoming.    "
316270,2659513,2012-10-19,1231595,Kelli & Curtis,"jen's place was great! it was clean and convenient to the metro, and jen provided coffee so we could start our days off right. also, having an iron and ironing board, extra blankets, and a fully stocked kitchen with a real oven/stove in the unit was so helpful. we came back late at night several times and felt very safe walking through the residential neighborhood.  markets and restaurants were close by on georgia avenue.
we had some special circumstances and jen was super accommodating - extremely friendly, responsive and worked everything out for us. thanks again for being such a great host, jen!"
316270,2768707,2012-10-31,3228976,Helen,we stayed for eight days and were more than happy with our accomodation. jen and john were so kind and invited us for dinner during hurricane sandy. the apart. was very clean and perfect for two adults. we were able to get the metro from the airport to petworth without changing to another line. it is about a ten minute walk to the apart.very accessible to downtown.we shopped at a local foodstore that had plenty of fresh organic food consequently we were able to make our own meals and save $$. we hope to be back.
316270,2852835,2012-11-10,4040548,Dawn,great apartment and close to the metro; i was very happy with my stay.
316270,2879129,2012-11-13,2905277,Amy,"apartment was exactly as listed and the hosts were very accommodating. we found it a great place to stay with our newborns: there is laundry and they brought down a pack-n-play and changing table. overall, a very nice, clean place with nice amenities and great hosts. "
316270,2897356,2012-11-16,296851,Lupe,"my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this apartment.  jen went above and beyond to accommodate our early check-in request.  it was easy and prompt to communicate with jen.  we would definitely recommend this apartment (location, comfort etc) to others."
316270,3723687,2013-03-08,5090744,Victoria,"stayed here with 2 girlfriends for a tourist visit of d.c. the metro station was a very quick (maybe 5 minutes) walk through a lovely neighborhood of brownstones. there were several excellent restaurants, bars and grocery options no more than another block from the metro. we felt safe in the neighborhood.

the apartment itself was very roomy, clean and exactly as shown in the photos. we loved the ""rain"" shower head. the kitchen is decently equipped with utensils, pots and pans, and dishes. jen and john were very kind to leave a variety of teas and coffees (for the lovely keurig machine), as well as some soda, water, beers and wine. they do ask an honor system for the drinks, but we found that very reasonable. it was very convenient to have these options there and we were happy to leave cash for their kindness.

we had two friends join us for one night, and the hosts were more than accommodating and understanding. overall a great experience and a place i would definitely come back to for another trip to the city."
316270,3821250,2013-03-18,3151334,Rina,"the place was very clean, had street parking, very close to the metro which was awesome. it was a bit cold/drafty for some reason, but they provided many blankets. tons of cups and things for us to use. comfortably fit the five of us (a proper bed, pullout couch, and a nice airmattress). as far as ""breakfast"" goes for the second ""b"" in b and b, there was tea and some great coffee. there were also some sodas, water bottles, and wine for purchase on the honor system."
316270,3938315,2013-03-29,5125068,Scott,i took a sightseeing trip with my family to d.c. as advertised the easy 2.5 block walk from the petworth metro stop was very convenient. we met jen and her family on our first night's stay.they were kind enough to recommend nearby dining options that we could walk to. the accommodations were very clean and having access to the laundry allowed us to pack light. this was a great introduction to airbnb.
316270,3988643,2013-04-01,409959,Colin,jen's apartment was very clean and well prepared for our stay. iced coffee in the fridge was a nice touch!
316270,4063383,2013-04-07,5084137,Sean,"our stay at jen's place was awesome! me and my wife and two friends were in d.c. for a week visiting my sister. everything was just as described and it was very comfortable for our group of four (for two nights we even had 5 people as my sister joined us for convenience). the apt. was very close to the metro, and, as a group, we felt safe walking through the neighborhood at any hour. my wife loved the provided coffee and tea, and i would recommend stopping into sweet mango cafe and/or domku- both just a few blocks away. it is worth keeping in mind that to get to most of d.cs tourist and other hot spots by metro you will be doing a lot of transfers, as there is not too much off of the green/yellow lines that run to the neighborhood. parking was also a breeze, esp. for d.c., just remember to check the street sweeping schedule posted on the block. all in all, i would highly recommend jen's property and we are looking forward to our next trip!"
316270,4137930,2013-04-13,4158486,Wendy,"first time using the airbnb.com website and the jen's place was marvelous. the apartment was perfect location from downtown and the whole family enjoyed the stay. if we need to return to dc, we will contact jen first. "
316270,4235668,2013-04-21,5563705,Mary,"jen's place was exactly as described -- clean, modern, up to date with everything you & your fellow travelers need for exploring dc. the location near the metro stop was very convenient -- and priced well to boot. we saved $1,000 off the hotel room my husband had booked (for a 7 night stay) before i convinced him to try airbnb. thanks, jen!"
316270,4315020,2013-04-27,1340357,Erica,"i had a great stay at jen's apartment in petworth with my mom. the apartment is exactly as described and pictured. the queen bed in the room is very comfy, the kitchen is great, and they have cable and wireless internet. if i had to list any drawbacks i guess i would say the space is a little dark due to being a basement apartment. but, for a great, clean apartment that is so reasonably priced i wouldn't let this hold me back from staying here again! i would say this would be an ideal spot for a couple to stay and have plenty of room. the bathroom is connected to the bedroom so i don't think i would want to stay here with another couple but that's a personal preference i guess.
jen was a terrific host, answering my questions very quickly and even allowed us to check out an hour late. "
316270,4565652,2013-05-13,904339,Justin,"we had a group 5 and felt very comfortable in jen's apartment. everything was as advertised including the proximity to metro. jen was very responsive to emails and helpful throughout our stay. i highly recommend jen's apartment, it was a great experience. "
316270,4622079,2013-05-16,2872711,Daniel,"our stay was excellent. everything was as advertised, the apartment was nice and stocked with everything we needed. easy private access, easy walk to metro, and a quick ride to everywhere we wanted to go. communication with jen was timely and clear. would recommend to anyone. "
316270,4654139,2013-05-18,6279644,Marcelo,"very nice place, comfortable, near of subway station and markets and no problem to parking, and better away to know the city is by subway, go to everyplace tourist. the city itself is  awesome, clean, people very friendly and many and many things to see."
316270,4697020,2013-05-20,3890726,Kat,"the place was exactly as pictured, the fold out couch was more comfortable than your average fold out couch (the bed was great!) and the kitchen was fully stocked with all utensils we could need! thanks!"
316270,4766400,2013-05-24,4154358,Efe,"she is very professional on hosting and her place is well-equiped  with all new and clean stuff.

316270,4920552,2013-06-02,5909385,Mardel,charming and clean with all necessities.  quiet neighborhood.
316270,5050412,2013-06-10,5433238,Chris And Darcy,"we rented this apartment for a couple friends that were coming to dc to celebrate our wedding.  jen was extremely helpful and accommodating during a pretty stressful time.  she was so quick to respond to emails, which was really helpful

the place was wonderful, clean, and in a great area.  our friends loved the place and i also stayed 1 night there.  i would highly recommend the place, which is close to down town and some great neighborhood restaurants/bars."
316270,5231202,2013-06-19,6420789,Simona,booked this place for a weekend for me and my visiting friends + significant others- six people total. great location - very close to metro. hosts had beers in the fridge which was great for a post-check-in refreshment. had so much fun. definitely would recommend/stay again!
316270,5278640,2013-06-22,6542579,Crystal,"this place was very comfortable, clean, and easy to get to from the metro. we were in town for a conference, and i think it only took no more than 20 minutes to get to the convention center. we appreciated how it felt more like home than a hotel room!"
316270,5376166,2013-06-27,4840381,Julia,jen was a great host and the apartment was perfect for us.  the home was very comfortable with a great tv and heaps of channels for kids and also us parents.  the apartment is just up the street from a nice deli and the train right to town is very close.  the neighborhood is very friendly and washington as a place to visit was excellent.
316270,5443171,2013-06-30,4147920,Jeff,"the apartment was as clean as the pictures show.  many pluses for  a very clean apartment.  after 2-3 days in the apartment we felt very comfortable.

the apartment was in a basement of a row house in a transitioning neighborhood.  although i did not feel unsafe, this location might not be suitable for everyone.

the barred door going into the apartment was not easy to open up with the key.  i mentioned this to john and he said he used wd-40, however it did not seem to help.  this needs to be fixed.  i do not want to struggle with a lock in a strange neighborhood when i am trying to get into the apartment.

the first thing one sees after opening up the barred door is a storage room.  it is not tidy, and does not give one a good first impression.  when traveling with a wife and child, first impressions are very important.

it was not a period of a warm summer weather, so i attempted to change the air conditioning settings.  whatever i did was wrong and not working, and the fan went onand would not shut off.  i texted john to come down to see if he could fix what i had done, and he could not.  consequently, the fan was on the whole 3 days that we were there.  with the vent above the bed, it was uncomfortable.

there was some food items that were in the refrigerator that i believed were for our use.  unfortunately, the expiration date on the eggs was a year old.  they should have been tossed out.

this was an average stay for us.  it could have been much worse, but it could have been much better.

316270,5645554,2013-07-09,2744518,Lars,"jen's place was perfect for exploring dc. it was just around the corner from the metro, very clean, and a great place to get some rest after a long day wondering around. jen was also a great host and helped us find a perfect place to see the fireworks (on the 4th of july) as soon as we arrived. i hope i get another chance to visit dc soon and stay here again."
316270,5691121,2013-07-12,6014117,Julie,"the apartment was as promised, clean, and close to the subway which was very much appreciated. there was plenty of crockery, bed-linen for the sofa bed, and the fridge was well stocked with an honesty box, which we enjoyed. it was a great place to stay with very friendly  neighbours, who made a point of chatting to us, and jen managed the whole process with efficiency, courtesy and warmth."
316270,5763477,2013-07-15,1904369,Jeffrey,it was a great place. jen was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. it is a short walk to the metro and a fun neighborhood. highly recommended!
316270,5875360,2013-07-20,7418833,Emily,"we had a great stay in the apartment. the instructions were clear, jen was efficient and helpful via email throughout the stay. the apartment is really nice and clean. it is in the basement, which was a welcome relief from the heat of the dc summer - not sure what it would be like in winter. we were a big group of 5 (3 in the lounge, 2 in the bedroom) so the only thing that might need to be considered for others is that access to the bathroom is through the main entrance. for us that wasn't a problem. we also had 2 guests with wheel chairs and despite a couple of steps up and down into the apartment access was totally fine. great that we could park the car with a paid permit while we were there. totally recommend the place. "
316270,7130861,2013-09-07,8636820,Melissa,our family of 5 had a great stay!  we would definitely book again!
316270,7467159,2013-09-21,1509482,Chris,"very happy with jen's place and jen's hospitality. jen was very quick to respond, provided great practical input and the flat was full of useful guidelines on how to access internet etc. 

the flat was as advertised, clean, fully equipped and very functional. only minor negative comment is that the sofa-bed in the lounge is a little uncomfortable for anyone over 100kg - but maybe i'm just getting old ;).

great central neighbourhood for getting around dc. jen recommended the local brasserie ""chez billy's"" around the corner - fantastic french/belgian food!

unfortunately we only had one day in dc as we were on a business trip, but expect a longer stay next time and will definitely come back to jen's place - thanks guys, hope to see you again soon."
316270,7564016,2013-09-24,3471973,Sau-Woon,"jen is a fantastic host. will always answer any queries you have quickly and very accommodating regarding checking in and out. very well stocked and equipped apartment. 

the only things to note, which are no fault of jens, is that we got a parking ticket for not parking in the same direction as traffic. in the uk, we don't have this rule so were not aware of this. also, although the apartment is not far from city centre, the metro is not very frequent later in the night. 

i would defiantly considering staying here again."
316270,7846836,2013-10-06,1658523,Susan,"my husband and i have had a visit to washington, dc on our bucket list for years.  we couldn't have picked a better place in which to stay.  the apartment is so comfortable.  it was so nice to return to such a great place to kick back and relax every evening.  the location was ideal to meeting our needs.  we didn't want to rent a car.  we knew the best way to get around is with the metrorail system.  the apartment is only a short walk to one of stations for economical transportation to all government attractions.  the apartment is secure, well equipped and met all our needs.  we enjoyed meeting jen's delightful family.  if we are ever fortunate to return to washington, dc, we would definitely stay at this apartment."
316270,7960797,2013-10-10,7856361,Rick,great location. accommodations were clean.
316270,8088812,2013-10-15,103692,Barbara,"jen's basement appartment is exactly as advertised.
it was clean and very convenient to the metro, and jen provided coffee, milk,... and a lot of goodies in the fridge.
although we could not see many museums because the government shutdown we had a great time in washington.

316270,8291132,2013-10-24,7075510,Kimberly,"we had a great time in dc and staying in jen's apartment was a big part of this.  it is very close to the metro and in a safe neighborhood; we felt comfortable walking back to the apartment at midnight.  the apartment is clean and quiet and well stocked with towels, blankets, etc.  the couch was comfortable for sleeping.  we didn't cook while there but the kitchen is well stocked for anyone who wanted to do so.  loved the shower and there is plenty of hot water.  we were not able to meet jen during our stay but she was very quick to respond to our emails.  would certainly consider staying here again."
316270,8643283,2013-11-10,1383394,Melody,"jen and john were awesome! the place looked exactly how displayed at airbnb, and jen very nicely left me coffee etc as i arrived very late at night. it is close to the metro and would enable guests to get around easy. unfortunately i twisted my knee the day after i arrived and that caused havoc for me. jen and john rescued me by getting crutches for me and helping me out in a million ways! i cannot thank them enough and i don't know how i would have managed without their help. their girls are adorable too! i highly recommend their place and they are wonderful people."
316270,8770555,2013-11-17,836248,Laetitia,"best place i've ever booked via airbnb!
what i liked the most was that it was the 1rst time i arrived in a place that had been cleant before my arrival and that i didn't have to do the previous guests' cleaning myself!
everything was just as described on jen's profile! besides, jen is always quick to answer any question and i didn't get to meet her during my stay but her instructions are always very clear.
her place is very cosy, quiet and private and i recommend it. will stay there again myself when i'll travel to dc again!"
316270,8935526,2013-11-26,4943378,Clare,nice comfy bed and linens. apartment was clean and as described. it was a lovely stay in jen's place.

louisa is very friendly, and she helped make my stay so easy and comfortable.  i would recommend her and her place to anyone, and i hope to stay with them again!"

321642,1531593,2012-06-21,2585448,Bryan,"we very much enjoyed our stay! louisa was very accomodating. we had everything we needed. all of the dc sites were easy to get to by metro or walking. it was lovely to stay in a pleasant, quiet neighborhood instead of a commercial district. thank you!"
321642,3395160,2013-01-22,4601548,John,"louisa was very friendly, gracious and accommodating. the space was clean, roomy and worked perfectly for our needs. we also really appreciated the parking space that we were able to use as we were in town for the inauguration and parking was limited. i definitely recommend her place."
321642,3404848,2013-01-23,3242273,Jane,"louisa and peter were so lovely and super accommodating. our booking was very last minute and they made it work. it is a very new and stylishly refurbished basement apartment, 2 big thumbs up. it is very close to the metro and an easy walk to the capitol. and the bed linen was 5 star."
321642,3505812,2013-02-09,4967905,Kristi,"what a great first airbnb experience.  perfect location, very convenient to metro and a very walkable neighborhood.  louisa and her family were great hosts.  will look forward to visiting them on another trip."

321642,3881071,2013-03-24,207365,Liz,louisa was a great host.   we had some back and forth before my arrival to figure out details.   i had to stay at another work location in dc before my arrival and louisa offered to pick me up - very helpful.   i had a bit of difficulty arriving/departing using the back gate and again louisa sent more instructions and some photos to help me figure it out.   comfortable space.   great location.
321642,3960339,2013-03-31,5019549,Elizabeth,"louisa is a fantastic host, she went out of her way to help us with our very early check-in and as so very kind to drop us at union station on our last day, just wonderful. the apartment is very well located, clean, and well furnished. the fold out sofa bed and regular bed were comfortable, we slept very well. a short walk to some good cafés, to the train line and we walked to the national mall from our place with no trouble. i recommend a stay at eastern market english basement!"
321642,4157590,2013-04-15,1627916,Robert,"my 7yo daughter and i had a great stay here.  louisa was very thorough in directions and coordinating the keys, as we were getting in very late and she was out of the country.  the place was pretty simple, but just what we needed.  the neighborhood was excellent, with a metro stop about 4 short blocks away, and several restaurants two blocks away.  the laundry in the unit was helpful and we didn't mind the lack of a oven or stove.  there was a hot plate, but we didn't need it.  we did decide to rent a car at the end of the trip to get out of dc, and coordinated parking with peter, which was no problem.    if you are looking for a home base in dc where you sleep and recharge for a bit here and there, this is a great spot.  if you are looking for a place to hang out for half the day, it may not be ideal because it is a basement apartment.  i would stay here again."
321642,4267425,2013-04-23,3205145,Adrian,"louisa is a charming hostess, very friendly and her basement flat perfectly placed for quick access to the museum centre and to a lively shoppingand restaurant area. we had a great stay."
321642,4490688,2013-05-08,5268831,George,"spent a wonderful 10 days here. the location is ideal, couldn't have been better. walking distance to the metro, restuarants, and the capitol. particularly loved the neighborhood with the beautiful homes and friendly people. we were pleasantly surprised and had no hesitation walking home late at night. the apartment was spacious and had all the necessities needed for a comfortable stay. 
louisa and her family were very nice and accomodating, and even provided parking in their back yard for our rental car. we were a bit nervous as this is the first time we have made this type of arrangement, but it went without a hitch. i would highly recommend louisa's place when you visit dc."
321642,4582990,2013-05-13,6015794,Ugur,louisa is a great host and she even picked us from the airport and gave us a quick tour around the city. her apartment was clean and comfortable.
321642,4702961,2013-05-21,5405979,Dale,our week at louisa's eastern market english basement apartment could not have been better.  a comfortable place to stay within walking distance to many great restaurants and of course the oh so convenient metro. louisa was so kind to even meet us at the metro on our arrival to assist with our luggage and offer a tour of the neighborhood. we hope to stay there again in the future.
321642,4961660,2013-06-04,5017247,Samantha,"we stayed with louisa for two nights this summer on a weekend away to washington, d.c. the apartment was clean, spacious, and private. it was an easy walk to the national mall (or to the metro, which came in handy when it rained!). louisa was very helpful - she offered suggestions for where to eat and left some tourist pamphlets in the apartment. she was also very flexible about check-in and check-out times. highly recommended!"
321642,8011688,2013-10-12,6619808,Scott,"this place was great!  very large and great for two people traveling.  it was in a nice quiet neighborhood with a park across the street.  the subway station is a five minute walk and it's a breeze getting to and from the city.  the kitchen had a big fridge and dishwasher, and there is a washer and dryer as well if you need to do laundry.  i highly recommend staying here!  "

321642,9329930,2013-12-22,206867,Jeff,"excellent location and friendly hosts. the basement apartment is well-appointed with kitchenette and laundry. our only issue is that the floors in the main house are not insulated, so you hear children running around early in the morning through the evening and it can make it difficult to sleep at times."
326938,1823855,2012-07-28,2999669,Charlotte,"mary beth dye was a great host. she took care of everything and was very helpfull towards us. she was very nice and made our stay wonderfull.the house, our bedroom and the bathroom were very clean and we felt really welcome. the house is in a great neighberhood, very close to the acces of public transportation and the supermarket is just 5 minutes way. 
when we go back to dc, we will definitely return to this wonderful house. our experience was great!"
326938,1864658,2012-08-01,2961871,Sarah,"great room for a great price! mary beth is very sweet, and was very hospitable -- she even left chocolates on our pillows! the neighborhood is really great, very convenient to georgetown, embassy row dumbarton gardens, rock creek park, and more. it's a bit off the beaten path -- probably not the best place to stay if you want to troll the mall and look at monuments for the whole of your visit -- but if you leave that to the tourists with fanny packs and would rather see dcs most beautiful parks, the zoo (pandas!), and explore the nw quadrant (home to dcs oldest and most beautiful neighborhoods), stay with mary beth! (and if you really want to see the monuments, the bus to downtown dc stops right outside and will get you there in 30 minutes!)"
326938,2162068,2012-09-01,2556175,Maria,"a nice house in a great neighborhood . great location,within waking distance from restaurants, safeway, wholefood,bus station, cvs pharmacy, public library,shops,hospitals,etc...whatever you are looking for, its just a walking distance from the house really a great location house. gergetown neighborhood is safe and easy to walk around..
mary was such a great host,friendly available and ready to give you some advices, she is also a great chef!! :-)
i would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!!"
326938,2822691,2012-11-07,1759189,Silvia,"the apartament is very very nice. the location is comfortable, there are a lot of transports near there, and you can reach the downtown quickly.
the neighborhood is very very good, georgetown is the best of the city and there is a good nightlife but not too noise.
mary beth is fantastic, she is polite and she has helped  us for everything in every situation (also when sandy herricane arrived). she has took us for the tour of the city and cooked us a lot of good meals. we send a lot of hugs to mary beth and we invite her here in florence! silvia lorenzo e nicole"

326938,4107952,2013-04-10,3007945,Tim,"we spent 3 nights here and really enjoyed our stay. we arrived quite late in the evening and we were very pleased that mary beth was at the house to welcome us. we were lucky enough to enjoy a glass of wine- very welcome after a day of travelling! georgetown is the best place to stay when visiting washington dc and chateau bleu is so conveniently placed. we used the circulator bus from union station and it was practically door to door in 30 minutes. it was also just a very short walk to the house from the bus stop- very convenient when you are towing luggage! the bedroom, bathroom and kitchen were all more than adequate for us- the beds were comfortable and there was plenty of space. the lounge downstairs was also spacious and comfortable to just sit around at the end of a day or plan what you were going to do during the day. out the back we could sit out on a decked area- nice and quiet.  we had great weather while in dc and as luck would have it, we hit it for cherry blossom weekend. georgetown has plenty of nice restaurants and bars and they were all pretty much in walking distance for us- and no more than a short bus ride for those that don't like to walk! we found public transport to be very good and mary beth made travel passes available to us which we could just top up according to what we might use.  mary beth was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble. our stay was all the more enjoyable for just being made to feel at home. we would stay here again and if the opportunity comes up again to visit dc- we will!"
326938,4397276,2013-05-02,5775892,Kathryn,"hi mary beth,

our employee bobby was very happy to have stayed with you. pls see below:

""thank you so much for your hospitality.  i enjoyed staying here.  everyday was like i was home and felt like family.  :)

i hope we continue to be friends; i'm only a few blocks away.  come visit if you have time.

oh, and thank you for the meatloaf and most amazing pumpkin chocolate bread i've ever tasted.  you're a great person.

may god continue to bless you.

thanks again for your constant communication and for accomodating us. we would look to book with you again."
326938,4986333,2013-06-05,6267521,Vicki,"we just had a great stay at mary beth's home in georgetown. she is just blocks to georgetown university and all the great shops. the safeway grocery store is across the street with a cicrulator bus stop and the national cathedral is also walking distance. you can walk or take the bus everywhere.
this was the first time booking through airbnb and i didn't really know what to expect. not only was it less expensive than a hotel, she was a lot of fun to get to know. both of my children were with me and they loved her.

326938,6112451,2013-07-30,7291904,Nancy,this spot was all about location for me on this visit and the house was spot on for that.  very convenient to all the places that we wanted to go and the public transportation options were great.

 you can the things you want to do in washington dc for the house is close to all the bus stops. in the evening there are plenty of places to eat or have a drink.
i would stop with her again and i would recommend her to friends or anyone. "

339208,996771,2012-03-13,1787974,Ian,"i stayed the weekend with my parents and wife.  wayne was a kind and _very_ helpful host. we found everything we needed and wayne provided helpful advice on places to go and how to get there. the apartment was fine with plenty of room for 4 people. it is located right next to the metro station so it was very easy to get downtown. all in all, we had a wonderful stay in dc."
339208,1019019,2012-03-19,378624,Laurie,"wayne had stocked the fridge sufficient enough so that we did not have to take the time to rush to a grocery store. he was a helpful and warm host. the apartment was clean and well appointed. dad would have appreciated a tv. he missed his show.  it is very close to the subway and most of what you might need to get to in dc as a tourist is within a 20 minute subway ride from the apartment. 

thanks to wayne. good health and happiness to him."
339208,1041690,2012-03-25,1936747,Nacho,"wayne was a really good host with us. he tooke care of every single detail since the begining. he picked us up at the subway station, he gave us an amazing breakfast, he always helped us with everything we needed. appart from the hospitality of wayne, the house was pretty comfortable, clean and nice, what makes a perfect combination. we really enjoyed the time we spent in washington and if we would have the opportunity to go back we will choose wayne again."
339208,1077773,2012-04-03,1475695,David,"great place to stay on extended trips to d.c.

having the metro so close is a real winner given that their isn't much else in the neighborhood.  the apartment was very clean and well kept and the added bonus of a stocked fridge was much appreciated.

wayne was very helpful with any little questions we had and i would recommend staying here to anyone.

339208,1135880,2012-04-16,1784112,Tomas,"nice flat. wayne is great guy. helped us with the parking, gave us a huge amount of tips&tricks and cooked a great chicken. perfect, thanks so much."
339208,2607114,2012-10-14,3329150,Chao,it was great affordable place to stay in dc. the location is easy to access metro station and also for driving to the mall area in 10 mins. the grocery shopping like eastern market and wegman are aslo in driving distance. thanks for wayne helped me to get a street parking permit for my car.
339208,2675269,2012-10-21,3833097,Devon,"wayne's apartment was clean, spacious, and comfortable. the stocked kitchen was a big relief, as there isn't a big grocery store nearby, and a plus if you don't want to go out for breakfast every morning. it's very close to the metro station. i could see it from the apartment, about a 5 minute walk. i didn't have to drive anywhere for my whole stay, which was great. wayne was right upstairs, and he is very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.

i heard several emergency sirens, which made me feel a little uneasy at first, but then i remembered that the police station and fire department are nearby. i was traveling solo, and along with precautions one should take in any area, i felt safe and comfortable here. "
339208,3163916,2012-12-27,4118132,Adityo,"wayne's place is excellent and i would recommend it to anyone who are looking a place in dc. me and my friends, a total of 8 people, enjoy a great stay at wayne's place during our winter holiday. it is very close to the subway station and the place is very comfortable for us. it has two bedrooms and a living room that fits for 3-4 people. i do not only recommend the place, but also wayne himself. he is a very pleasant host and very attentive to our needs. you can contact him by phone or emails directly. long story short, wayne himself is the center that makes us feel at home. thank you so much wayne! :)"
339208,3690653,2013-03-04,5139542,Julia,wayne is amazing!  he was such a kind and gracious host. the fridge was stocked and the apartment was so clean!  the apartment is very spacious and comfortable. it was very comfortable for children. the location is great because it is less than a block to the metro. wayne is one of the friendliest and nicest people we have ever met!  we are blessed to know him. 
339208,3767189,2013-03-12,5191672,Isaac,"wayne was incredibly warm and generous as a host; he even went beyond simply accommodation. wayne also made sure my friends and i knew how to get around and even provided a fully stocked kitchen and fridge for the entire duration. it is not a stretch to say that i had a better experience at wayne's than some hotels where i had to pay more for.
i thoroughly enjoyed my stay with him and he was the best host anyone could hope for. highly recommended."
339208,4019958,2013-04-03,4880201,Barbara,"what a nice appartment: great location near subway, great owner and at 20 min from capitol! wayne was so nice: fridge contained food, beverages and everything for breakfast! in addition he helped us for parking permit, church information and gave us wdc information (points of interest..) just one thing: if you want to buy food and have no car, do it at wdc directly when visiting. the nearest grocery safeway is at 1,8 km...really recommended!"

339208,4204650,2013-04-18,4852189,Swahili,"wayne is the perfect host of dc. an attentive, considerate, knowledgeable & warm person. we arrived late in dc from a 4hr foggy drive with our 2yo had developing fever during the drive. wayne is ""psychic"" - the fridge was thoughtfully stocked around the needs of a family (we have 3kids!) so dinner was instantly taken care of that night. the accommodation is quaint & cosy, extremely clean (pass my mumy sanitization test) & the birds in the backyard was an instant hit with the kids.
the metro is only 5minutes walk away and that is ultra convenient for a traveling family like us. huge grocery store 2metro stops away or quick pickups across the road. dc town and trendy restaurants only 4-6stops away.
if youre looking for an outta of hotel experience in dc, let it be at wayne's. 

ps:wayne, again thank you. bless your kind heart."
339208,4278044,2013-04-23,3520767,Fotios & Rebecca,"without doubt the most hospitable generous and engaging host i've ever had. wayne's spirit for life makes for many an interesting conversation! nice area, very convenient, fantastic area to live in, just a fantastic choice for anyone."
339208,4476795,2013-05-07,4080641,Mary Ellen,"wayne was an excellent host; friendly and most helpful...he even cooked food for us on our late arrival!  besides stocking the kitchen most generously, he was a great ambassador for the city.
the bed was comfortable, and the shower was great!  everything clean and well kept. the neighborhood was down-to-earth, just 4 metro stops from the capitol; with a good seafood & soul food take-out on the corner; we liked eating in after a long day and enjoyed having so much space to relax in.  "
339208,4552324,2013-05-12,5841272,Muriel (Mo),"wayne was the perfect host. warm, thoughtful, generous. the apartment was clean, tidy, and comfortable. the location is great -- 4 minutes to the metro. highly recommended."
339208,4635048,2013-05-17,4209306,Liuxi,"wayne is a really warming host. he picked us up in the metro station on the first day. he gave us lots of suggestions and detailed instructions before we came. since it was not our first time in d.c, we prepared everything before this trip. but we still want to thank him about his free metro cards and shopping cards. wayne also bought us extra mattress topping to make us live more comfortable. "
339208,4718362,2013-05-21,4377986,Duane,"i would definitely recommend anyone coming to dc to stay at wayne's apt. the apt itself is very comfortable and clean and has all the amenities you could need including a full kitchen and washer/dryer. the bed was also extremely comfortable.  the apt was close to the subway which was only a few stops from major attractions and museums. 

wayne was an excellent host, he gave us plenty of helpful sightseeing tips. he is a very friendly guy who is very respectful and welcoming.

thanks again wayne for a great stay."
339208,4773287,2013-05-25,3173491,Penny,wayne is such a warming person. he welcomed us and took us a little tour of his house the first day we moved in. he gave us free metro cards and coupons for shopping. the house is super clean and organized. we had an enjoyable stay at wayne's place. thank you!!!
339208,4873013,2013-05-30,5084520,Martin,"good location as a base to explore washington. just 200 yds to a metro station.

very friendly and helpful, especially the items in the fridge and the rum cocktails. the loan of the plastic metro cards was very useful.

4 adults from europe staying for 5 days

no parking problems. in fact, no problems at all. would return again.

339208,5054884,2013-06-10,6034590,Marcia,"we had a great time!  wayne is a fabulous host -- he exceeded our expectations.  he replied quickly to our emails, answered questions, provided suggestions, and checked in with us regularly during our visit to see if we needed anything.  accommodations comfortably met our needs for a family of 6.  easy, close access to the metro was great. well equipped kitchen and well stocked pantry made simple cooking easy.  lots of breakfast options for our kids. washer & dryer available and easy to use.  if we make it back to dc, we'd stay here again without hesitation. "
339208,5130854,2013-06-14,6335230,Dan,"wayne was an exceptional host, very warm and friendly.  there was everything one would need for a complete stay: bath towels, dishes, a modestly stocked fridge, soaps and shampoos, spare sheets, and even a washer-dryer with detergent.  the location from the metro was wonderful.  the neighborhood might look scary to some, but my wife and i had absolutely no problems.  it was, however, a bit noisy at night, as some people liked to ride and rev their motorbikes after midnight, so bring ear plugs.  if we ever go back to dc, we're definitely staying with wayne."
339208,5307494,2013-06-24,5153637,Sheri,"wayne is a fabulous host!!  the metro is just a block away, and took it everywhere!  the apartment is a bit older but neatly kept.  we were a bit worried about the neighborhood when we arrived, but ended up feeling quite safe.  "
339208,5558080,2013-07-06,6194653,Melissa,"we had a great stay at wayne's apartment. it had everything we needed, including some food in the fridge. the host was very friendly and took time to tell us about the city and show us on a map where we wanted to go. we would stay again."
339208,5880479,2013-07-21,5210892,Dinah,"staying in wayne's apartment was as good as, if not better than, staying with your favorite fun relative.  he met us at the airport and taught us how to use the metro, fed us a yummy lunch when we got home, took us to the national mall where a festival was going on and supplied us with tripcards (or something like that) for the metro.  that was just the first day!  our frig was stocked with food so we didn't have to run out to the store.  he worried about us if we came home late,helped us figure out how to get to the places we wanted to go, had us to his apartment for dinner and did not panic when we set the grill on fire.  i cannot imagine having a better host.  the beds were comfy, the water was hot, there were plenty of clean towels and a wonderful washer and dryer with laundry soap supplied.  the only bad part for me is there is no dishwasher and i was traveling with a thirteen year old grandson that did not know how to do dishes!  "
339208,6242805,2013-08-05,1936522,Wei-Lin,"wayne was an amazing host, he was there to greet us when we arrived and even made us meatballs and spaghetti because he knew we were arriving from a 24-hour long-haul flight!  he also had stacks of tourist info about washington dc, made sure we knew our directions and warned us about the metro closure the weekend we were staying.  lots of breakfast food and other amenities too.  if you're looking for a comfortable place to stay and friendly guide to the city, wayne's your man."
339208,6464695,2013-08-13,1249914,Shara,"wayne was a wonderful host.  we were so tired from our trip and amazed to find a fully stocked fridge with  hot chicken for our supper waiting.  wonderfully sweet tomatoes from his garden.  the apartment is comfortable and blissfully air conditioned.  the kitchen was well stocked with everything you could need.  wayne is a warm and friendly person who will try to make your stay as nice as possible.   he takes good care of his guests.  the bed was comfortable and the location was perfect.  the metro is only a block away and is an easy ride to everything you would want to see.  the apartment is clean and bright.  i highly recommend wayne's home.  you will enjoy your time there and he is a wonderful new friend in dc.  we will be back next year for sure.
"
339208,6807862,2013-08-26,6453302,Christopher,"wayne is a wonderful host!  the night i got there, i was exhausted from traveling, and wayne had a nice simple dinner prepared for me and a delicious rum punch (i mean very good).  the fridge was stocked with the essentials.  the apartment was very nice and clean, and the description of the neighborhood was accurate.   there is not much there.  it felt pretty safe to me, but i also had very little desire to explore the area at night.  the bus goes straight into the city and is much cheaper at rush hour than the metro and just as close.  this is a great place for people working in the city, but i might be a bit hesitant if you wanted to stumble home drunk at two in the morning, because there won't be a ton of foot traffic on the street although it is well lit.  to be fair, i came home a couple of nights on the metro around 11 and there were plenty of people getting off the train with me and walking the block and half to wayne's building so i felt safe.  as far as wayne goes, all the glowing reviews are completely accurate!  he is so helpful and nice.  "
339208,7237641,2013-09-13,6336070,Markus,wayne is a great and warm host. we really enjoyed our stay in his appartment which is great equipped. the flat is just a short walk down the street away from the metro station which brings you directly to the city. for some guests the people and also the area around may look a bit scary for the first view but we felt save and most of the people are very friendly and helpful. we can fully recommend wayne's appartment.  
339208,7360335,2013-09-17,685435,Yvonne,"wayne's house is a terrific base from which to explore washington dc. it is a 3 min walk to the nearest metro from which is about 20 mins to most of the major sights in washington dc. wayne's house was quiet, spacious and warm, containing every thing we would have needed (and more) for our 4 day stay in this city, and his house could comfortably fit 4 people. we found his house to be very secure and felt completely safe staying in the neighborhood - and personal safety is a high priority for me. 

his generosity and warmth as an airbnb host is truly outstanding and my husband had a very good time chatting to him during our stay. as wayne lives upstairs with separate facilities from us, it was very reassuring to have access to him when we had questions or required assistance during our stay.    

we would recommend his house to fellow travelers :)"
339208,8330409,2013-10-26,8985087,Jerome,"wayne is a great guest, full of attention for his hosts. fridge was full, a prepared chicken was waiting for us for our 1st dinner at arrival accompanied with a welcome drink. great. wayne gave us lots of good advices to visit the city and was checking up in the evening if everything was alright. he also gave some cakes for the kids one evening and was very nice to us.
appartment for 2 adults and 3 kids (4 would do as well) is ok, clean and tidy, well equipped if you wish to cook. located 100m from the metro, it is very convenient to go and visit the city. we were quite lucky to find a spot to park since there are only 3 spots close to the house. all the rest is 2h max. this is the only ""weak"" point, you overcome easily if you park once and for all and use metro afterwards. great place to stay if you plan some days to visit washington."
339208,8428665,2013-10-30,8756099,Natalie,"wayne was the perfect host.  the house was comfortable and well prepared.  wayne had just enough of the essentials to make the trip not stressful.  even helped us navigate the metro.  we had a blast, thanks wayne!"
339208,8738822,2013-11-15,1364348,Jill,"wayne is wonderful!    our group arrived at 2 separate times.  wayne met the first of us at the airport and showed them how to navigate the metro, use the smartcard, etc.  the loan of smartcards was very helpful.  he had food waiting for our dinner and so many breakfast options that we couldn't get to them all.  by the time i arrived the first group had finished their welcome-cocktails.   we were welcomed home a few evenings with more cocktails and treats.  breakfast supplies were restocked mid-stay.   
the apartment is as described.  very comfortable, convenient and clean.  we were impressed.  we like the proximity to the metro stop, you really can see it when you step out the front door.  wayne had printed out 4 pages of highlights and recommendations with directions.  these were clear and helpful.  we tried one of his recommended restaurants and it was the best food we had on the trip.  he was available for the few questions we had.   the neighborhood is working families, not nightlife, and this suited us well.   the bus behind the apartment, the 96, goes all the way across town.  while the metro is faster, you don't get to see the city, so we took the bus to the national cathedral and saw a cross section of the capital on the way.  it's also very economical.   we would definitely stay with wayne again, and in fact hope to come back in a year or two and see the sites we missed this time.

the apartment was very clean, spacious and comfortable.  the bed was especially comfortable!  marina and james stocked the fridge with some snacks, coffee, tea and milk.

we also enjoyed a fire in the fireplace.  and sitting out front watching the world go by.

it is a beautiful apartment, marina and james are wonderful hosts and we highly recommend it!"
355527,1086681,2012-04-05,543261,Calista,"marina and james were great hosts. they met us when we arrived and showed us evrything that we needed to know about the apartment which is just as great as the pictures!  we had a great stay and there is definitely no location as close to the key tourist and capital destinations.  we can't wait to go back!
"
355527,1098560,2012-04-08,1668891,Damon,"what a great place!  it's within very easy walking distance of the southeast corner of the mall; the entire mall can be walked with some effort (for those who haven't been in a while, the national mall is *big* - bring comfy walking shoes.)  the bikeshare and public transport encourage easy trips across the mall and further afield as well, but we ended up walking everywhere.

the kitchen was great, the apartment roomy and light, but there was so much to do as a tourist and so many great places to dine within a very short walk so much of that lovely house remained unused.

mariana was a wonderful host with great suggestions; i will absolutely return here when i next can."
355527,1138444,2012-04-16,2028264,JaeLynn,"marina and her husband were excellent hosts!  they helped us navigate the city and even drew us a map to bike to mt.vernon.  the apartment is lovely, and the location could not be better-  literally steps from the metro. we felt safe and had a wonderful time.   

special thanks to marina and her husband for being so patient- my attempts to cook led to setting off the smoke alarm - twice. : ).  they were so gracious each time. "
355527,1158965,2012-04-21,1938454,Bora,"great location near the metro and the national mall.  easily walkable.  the apartment was perfect for us and well decorated.  marina and her husband were great hosts.  we arrived late and she had sandwichs and snacks ready for us in addition to the snacks that were already in the fridge.  we got to talk to our hosts for a while and they are a great couple.  overall, a great experience."
355527,1185331,2012-04-26,1805866,Lynn,"this is a spacious, clean, comfortable private apartment.  marina's acceptance of our reservation request was timely (as opposed to some other washington hosts we tried) and james was waiting for us in the adirondeck chair in the  front yard at check-in time.  they live upstairs and are friendly and helpful.  very convenient location in a lovely, historic capitol hill neighborhood.  great access to the metro!  only 3 steps up to the apartment from the sidewalk.  the kitchen and bath are newly renovated.   only one minor flaw - the wooden bedroom floor is a little creaky - maybe it's a work in progress.  due to the hard floor surfaces, if you have sensitive feet, slippers would be a good idea.  was nice to have a fire in the gas fireplace on a chilly, rainy april evening while watching a dvd on the flat screen.  the kitchen refrigerator and cupboards were stocked with basic food items.  the frig had some bottled waters, juices, yogurt, milk and a bowl of fresh fruit -- greatly appreciated.  good value for the space and location -- would stay again."
355527,1196275,2012-04-29,1772889,Alison,"we felt like we were at a 5-star hotel in this beautiful apartment as there were so many thoughtful personal touches. marina was delightful. she gave us great details about and directions to everything we needed. locations really don't get any better. the bed was super comfortable and the apartment is immaculately clean, beautifully decorated and very spacious. i can't say enough about how wonderful our stay was, except that it was too short. we hope to return again very soon.

the apartment itself was exactly as depicted.  wi-fi was great; a/c worked well and the back patio was very nice for a late night glass of wine.

location was also fantastic - close to eastern market and capitol hill.  all in all, there was nothing that disappointed.  if we return to dc, this is where we hope to stay.

355527,3229184,2013-01-02,4192886,Roland,"wonderful apartment! wonderful location!  wonderful hosts.  we would definitely want to stay there again!  we, a party of three, myself and two foreign guests, had a wonderful 4 ½ day stay in marina’s apartment. 

the location was wonderful, but first, i’ll tell you about the apartment.  

the apartment was clean, spacious, very brightly and attractively decorated.  it had all the amenities anyone would need, including free wi-fi and a laundry machine.  the apartment was nicely laid out.  a large bedroom with a large bed and spacious closet at one end of the apartment.  next to that, a nice bathroom.  next to that, more closet space in the hallway.  then a large, beautiful kitchen with lots of counter space and cupboard space, and good knives and other utensils for cooking.  and just beyond the kitchen, at the other end of the apartment, a large dining room/ living room combination with attractive furniture that made into sleeping spaces for 2 or 3 people, and they also provided a roll-away bed for one more person, if we wanted to use it.  the convertible furniture was so comfortable for sleeping that we never used the roll-away bed.

the hosts marina and james were very friendly, very accommodating, very helpful, straightforward and articulate in their instructions, suggestions, and recommendations.  i would have liked to have spent more time with them because they seemed like the kind of people i would want to become friends with.  while walking one day, i happened to injure my knee and couldn’t put any weight on my left leg.  james and marina went out and bought a pair of crutches for me.

they lived right upstairs and were easily available by phone if we needed anything or had any problems with the apartment.

they provided some food items and beverages and laundry soap to get us started and also provided a helpful information notebook with maps, recommendations and suggestions for nearby grocery stores, cleaners, restaurants, metro stops, etc.

the apartment was very comfortable.  there was a pass through window between the kitchen and the dining area.  

the location was great.  it was about a 20 minute walk from union station, a short walk to the capitol.  there were several restaurants, a bar, and a metro station at the end of the block.  we were able to walk all over washington from the apartment.

355527,3288449,2013-01-06,4069558,Roxane,"james and marina's apartment is excactly as advertised.  we felt like we were visitng a 5-star hotel as we were welcomed into a warm room with the fireplace going.  there was a fruit bowl on the counter and orange juice and milk in the frig., along with an assortment of teas and coffees.  cereal, peanut butter, and jelly were also in the kitchen -- which made us feel very welcomed.  james gave us a quick tour of the apartment, showed us a binder on all the places to go and how to get there, and then left us to ourselves.  the apartment is located so that you can walk anywhere and everywhere.  we took a taxi from the airport to the apartment and then back;  otherwise we walked everywhere.  i would stay here again the next time we are in dc, which is a wonderful city to see."
355527,3724774,2013-03-08,1479404,Rizwan,"marina and james were great hosts. the apt is as advertised and even better. it has all the amenities, including all the small touches (coffee maker, hair dryer, ironing table, toiletries, etc) that you would need. this is a perfect location for sightseeing the capitol and less than a block away from the metro station. james provided loads of useful information regarding restaurants and other things. the unlimited supply of chocolate kisses in the hallway was very nice! would definitely recommend a stay in this apt."

355527,3939761,2013-03-29,5243390,Samantha,"my son and i had a delightful stay in dc, and marina and james could not have been more gracious or more helpful. the apartment was just as described and just as it looks in pictures--tastefully decorated without any clutter and very clean. my son is allergic to dairy so instead of milk, i requested a very specific brand of soy milk, which isn't always easy to find. it was there upon our arrival, along with fresh fruit, coffee, orange juice, and all of the necessities. 

the apartment is a very short walk to the metro, where you can access all of dc's attractions: the mall, the zoo, the white house, the spy museum, newseum, restaurants...literally, everything! it's very easy to navigate.

wifi was available, as promised, and we brought a streaming device so we could access our netflix account. it's not necessary--the apartment gets basic tv--but it was fun to watch movies at night.

the apartment is quiet and comfortable, safe and convenient, and the hosts are terrific. i can't rave enough..."

355527,4441861,2013-05-06,2919480,Tom,"""steps to us capitol"" is a great little place for a nice peaceful getaway. its clean, quiet and cozy. it was just steps and a short walk to the metro made getting around a breeze. being from the country, my wife was a bit hesitant about walking, but we could have not felt safer, even at night. there is a great mexican place at the end of the block, a subway sandwich and an all you need liquor store; its walking distance to the happenings at eastern market and on 8th street. 
we had thought about renting  a car, but glad we didnt as everything we could have wanted was in walking distance or by rail. you can even get to the place from dca on the metro much cheaper than a cab.
we didnt get to meet james but marina was great. she is on my list of ""places to stay"" for sure. thanks marina!"

355527,5177191,2013-06-17,5718763,Trudi,"whether or not you enjoy your stay at ""steps to us capitol"" depends upon your expectations.
the location is brilliant - very good selection of restaurants and cafés within walkable distance. for sightseeing purposes, you are perfectly placed - for those who walk as well as for those who prefer to use the metro.
the photos of the apartment were clearly taken at a much earlier date. the wear and tear on the faux leather sofa, for instance, was detected at first glance.
more importantly however, we were very much surprised by the erratic behavior of the landlords. both marina and her husband wavered from almost friendly to outright hostile without warning. when politely asked if they would be willing to give us a taxi number when departing, we were told to drag our luggage to the nearest hotel and ask there. they emphasized they were not a hotel and didn't provide such a ""service"". when we (two 65 year olds) made the slightest noise, they proceeded to hang handwritten signs throughout their property ""teaching"" us how to be more quiet. quite frankly, we wondered on various occasions why they were in this business. 
all in all, we would not return. the human element was a disaster.

note to marina:

life's experience and observations - as well as our studies in human psychology - have shown us that a quick temper can cloud one's judgement and prompt underlying hostilities, rooted elsewhere in one's psyche, to surface. this unproductive behavior is - as we experienced first-hand with you and your husband - detrimental to business relationships. we are afraid that you are exaggerating the situation and/or confusing us with other tenants.

our recommendation is that you work on calming yourself should you feel stressed or otherwise unable to cope with your environment. politically incorrect statements and accusations targeted at paying tenants are surely behaviors one would want to strive to discontinue.

we wish you success,"

marina is a great hostess and made us feel very welcome. she could tell us much about area and give tips. it was a great pleasure to be her guest and enjoy the great basement with a nice small garden. the rooms are big enough and well equipped,  kitchen and bathroom are in a very good condition and very well kept and pleasant. we can marina and the apartment only highly recommend and wish her much success!"

355527,6199286,2013-08-03,6447618,Luke,"i stayed at marina's apartment for 3 days and it was perfect.

marina was so friendly and helpful, responding to questions before my arrival and ensuring i arrived as easily as possible. 

when i arrived she kindly took the time to provide a quick run down of the city, asked about my dining preferences and gave recommendations as well as other tips and hints. 

the apartment is spacious, well furnished and clean and comfortable. best of all is the location. the capitol building and library of congress are minutes walk from the front door, the national mall, botanic gardens and other sights are either a short metro ride away (with the metro station at the end of the street), or a slightly longer leisurely walk.

the front garden and street are beautiful and safe. 

i have already told everyone i have spoken to about my trip about her place and how perfect it is. my only hesitation is - i want to stay again when i'm next in washington dc, so i don't want it to be booked out! :-)

thanks marina for being such a great host. i hope to visit again."
355527,6381229,2013-08-10,7364114,David,"this was the perfect place for part of our family vacation. location is superb for exploring washington dc. the apartment was clean, attractive, and comfortable, with a lot of small thoughtful details. marina was very friendly and helpful and responded very promptly to the one small midweek question we had. this was an excellent experience overall - i would recommend this place to others without hesitation."
355527,6560331,2013-08-17,5634114,Melissa,"my boyfriend and i stayed at marina's apartment for 4 days and had a wonderful time. when we arrived marina took the time to explain how the city was laid out, how best to navigate it, and some tips on using the public transportation. she also told us about the restaurants and grocery stores in the area. there was even a binder with a helpful map and several menus of area restaurants that delivered. the apartment itself was fantastic -- it was spacious and the kitchen was well stocked with cooking/dining utensils. but the best part was the location -- only 2 blocks to the capitol building and from there a scenic walk to the national mall and all the memorials and monuments. there were also several restaurants on the corner of marina's block. my boyfriend and i would spend the day walking or visiting museums, walk down to our block, grab some food from one of the restaurants, then walk the few steps to the apartment. my favorite was the thai restaurant but there was also a mexican restaurant and an american pub/café. we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again when next visiting dc. "
355527,7274015,2013-09-14,7278868,Kenneth,"we stayed at steps from the capital for three nights.  marina was very friendly and helpful at the time of check-in, providing much useful information.  in addition there were materials and maps in the apartment that afforded helpful information.
overall, the apartment was more than adequate, but is showing some signs of wear and tear… nothing that affected our stay in a negative way.  the best part was the location -- only 2 blocks to the capitol building, and close to the national mall, memorials, and monuments.  a perfect place to use as a base while exploring dc.  the apartment is very convenient to all forms of public transportation.  plenty of good restaurants in the neighborhood, as well as a few blocks away.  (for great mexican, try tortilla café, featured on diners, drive-ins and dives!)
considering price and location, i can recommend steps from the capital.
"
355527,8480412,2013-11-02,8083165,Richard,"it was a pleasure staying at this apartment on capital hill .excellent location and everything in the apartment very carefully thought out  by the hosts, marina and james. highly recommended."
355527,8592003,2013-11-06,1878941,Beth,"marina's place was a great home base for exploring all that dc has to offer. marina was away during our stay, so james showed us the apartment. we especially loved relaxing by the fireplace in the evenings.the only little thing that would make it better would be greater water pressure in the shower. overall, a lovely stay, quiet and relaxing yet steps from everything. "
355527,8655712,2013-11-11,1814852,Michael,"not great.  not bad.  alright, is the word i'd use to sum up our stay.  i would probably stay elsewhere if i returned to dc.  it's not that marina and james were bad; it's that every other host i've had was better.

pros:
- location is stellar, quiet hood, but close to everything
- apartment is large and clean
- climate control works well
- most typical things are provided (e.g., shampoo, soap, linens, etc...)
- unexpected niceties (e.g., fruit, juice, tootsie rolls)

cons:
- apartment is not as well maintained as the pics imply.  some tears in furniture.  walls are marked up. some paint chipping.

- mediocre communication from host.  i contacted host a few days before arrival, never received confirmation on their side that things were still good-to-go.

- water pressure in shower is meh.

- james and marina live on the floor above.  the floors must be thin, because we could hear every footstep they or their dog took.

- we never met marina in person, but james made us a little uncomfortable.  he was over-the-top polite and nice most of the time, but would switch to awkwardly passive-aggressive mid-stride.

- i sent a text to find out if there were kitchen utensils (spatula and/or tongs) and the response merely blamed another guest for screwing up the utensil(s).  no resolution or apology, just accusing others.

- kitchen was underwhelming.  it's only partially equipped (missing utensils, the only stove-top skillet is tiny, dull knives).  cooking anything with the stove-top makes the kitchen overly-hot due to poor ventilation.

- internet speeds were mediocre for an urban apartment, topped out at 2-3 mbps.

most of my complaints are not direct violations of the expectations spelled out in the listing, which is why i still gave 3 stars.  but overall, i don't think james and marina should be in this business.  they don't seem to enjoy it."
355527,8743741,2013-11-15,9622322,Lyn,"could not have asked for anything more. apartment roomy and comfortable with all the amenities we needed. marina and james were helpful but not intrusive. locality superb. literally 2 blocks from the capitol and one block from the metro. 
tear in sofa referred to by previous reviewer is being dealt with by the owners sure the water pressure could have been better in the shower but not a big deal.
would definitely recommend this to all."
355527,9124682,2013-12-09,460027,Lynn,"a great introduction to the us. warm, clean, well furnished and equipped. the location could not have been better. the bed was a joy to sleep in. thank you james and marina, we really enjoyed our stay."
382111,1094311,2012-04-07,476698,Kinga,"excellent flat, good location - we enjoyed using the metro and the
washington bike rental scheme to get to places. leafy, quiet, with
east market nearby for good food, cafes, beer etc. thanks for
having us!
in addition, micha is a fantastic host! very friendly, helpful, flexible and  responding promptly to the e-mails. thank you!"
382111,1149426,2012-04-18,294289,Dima,"micha was really flexible on check-in and check-out - huge thanks for that, as our flight arrived early. the basement is nice and has all you need to stay for a short term. location is also convenient, it's not the most walkable area, but metro is close so you ven get virtually anywhere pretty fast.
all in all, it's a basement, so you get what you pay for, nothing too fancy. still, significantly cheaper and better than an hotel, esp. in the same area."
382111,1221927,2012-05-03,2026033,Simone,"micha and brian were great hosts.  they really put a lot of thought and detail into outfitting the apartment. they were friendly, helpful and responded very quickly to requests."
382111,1267521,2012-05-12,2201218,R.,"we are a family with 2 little kids, travelling from europe. it was a great  house and location. micha was a fantastic host. everything was perfect and could not be better!"
382111,1298225,2012-05-18,1921376,Mara,"this apartment is wonderful. it is exactly as it appears in the pictures. what the pictures can't show you are all the small touches that make a stay here special, comfortable, and homey. plus the bed was soooo comfy. the location is great if you want to visit the mall or explore the capitol hill neighborhood. and it is a short walk to the metro.  micha and brian were perfect hosts - thoughtful, friendly, and helpful. definitely a 5 star experience!!"
382111,1341520,2012-05-24,2216723,Lesley,"we stayed with micha for 3 nights on our first ever visit to dc. it's a great apartment in an incredible location. this thoughtfully kitted out basement apartment is stylishly decorated and centrally located, and close to transport. it is a welcome respite to chill out in after a big day seeing the sights. superb hosts, lots of valuable insights in their custom guidebook."
382111,1857932,2012-08-01,2231589,Susan,"well appointed, streamlined studio. hosts are nice and accommodating but you'll have lots of privacy, too. can be a bit noisy because of traffic on 8th street -- but you're in the heart of a wonderful neighborhood! highly recommend."
382111,1900581,2012-08-06,2667531,Luz,"we were there for 3 night and we loved it! it is a great apartment, really light and cozy. it is completly furnish. the neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. and the capitol is really close! and, of course, micha and her husband were the perfect hostess, they give us all the turistic information that we needed and more!! :) for me was a good experience. "
382111,2265289,2012-09-11,1395462,Kurt,"micha and her family are so nice. they welcomed us even with home made brownies. delicious ! the appartment is great and was everything and more we've expected. location is super !!! walking disctance to the capitol, a flea market on sundays, restaurants,... a place to come back to when we visit washington dc again. don't hesitate to book here !!!"
382111,2298557,2012-09-16,1612524,Jillian,excellent location right in capitol hill with great restaurants around.  it was very quiet and cosy with no noise. the apartment is so well set up with everything you could possible need for your stay.  we were a family of 4 with 2 kids aged 4 & 8 and the apartment was perfect!  micha is a great host too!  highly recommend this apartment if you're staying in washington dc. 
382111,2602404,2012-10-14,3023956,Sarah,"we (family of 3 with a young child) stayed in the apartment for one month and had a wonderful time! plenty of bright daylight, very well equipped, and felt like home. the area was perfect- lovely neighborhood, very short walk to eastern market, restaurants, coffee shops, and easy walking distance to the capitol building, library of congress, supreme court.  we felt very safe, and enjoyed the proximity to many parks and playgrounds.  this was the perfect homebase for visits to the smithsonian museums (quick walk to orange-blue line, circulator bus stop.  redline is also walkable).   micha and family were great- helpful and accessible.  would stay here again and highly recommend. "
382111,2670653,2012-10-21,3452456,Kim,"micha and family were super hosts. a great place to stay, clean and comfortable. there was even coffee in the fridge! great neighborhood for traveling with kids! we look forward to staying with them again!"
382111,2721066,2012-10-26,3394120,Caroline,"a friend and i recently stayed with micha for 5 nights. the apartment was lovely! not only was it immaculate, but it also had everything we needed and proved a welcoming place to come back to after a long day of sight-seeing.
location wise, it is equidistant between two metro stations, neither one more than a ten minute walk away. there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby as well as a couple of supermarkets for those times we wanted to eat-in.
micha and her family were fantastic hosts - there if we needed them but not intrusive.
overall, a fantastic place to stay!!!"
382111,2759500,2012-10-30,3415297,Gwen,"this apartment was very cute and very comfortable.  located about a 7 minute walk from eastern market and on a beautiful capital hill street.  i came in for the marine corps marathon and was pleased that the queen bed was super comfortable (slept like a log before and after the race).  the apartment was spotless.  the bathroom was fully functional (ample clean towels included) and the washing machine and dryer were much appreciated.  the kitchen was cute and fully functional and included necessary utensils, plates and cookware.  micha was amazing and accommodated us by letting us stay extra days to wait out hurricane sandy.  we had a problem with the door and she came down to give us an extra set of keys at 3 in the morning with no complaint whatsoever.  

the only minor down sides (but don't effect my desire to stay there again) are that you will hear the little ones running around overhead (so bring earplugs if you want to sleep in) and the shower is pretty tight (so don't expect a spa).

we will definitely be staying here again when we visit my sister and after my parents saw the apartment they said they would like to book it for their next trip to dc.  

many thanks for making our (unexpected) extended stay great.

382111,3117764,2012-12-19,3728560,Jaime,"this was our first time in dc and using airbnb. we were very pleased. the location was very convenient and close to the sites we wanted to visit. micha was very accommodating and communicated very well with us on how to access the place. we were pleasantly surprised with a nice little treat upon our arrival. everything was well within walking distance (ie. eastern market, metro, union station, the capitol). the place was well equipped for us and our 7 month old son. we had a great time. thank you micha!"
382111,3292007,2013-01-06,4400196,Caroline,"micha and her husband were very kind, attentive and generous. the apartment was clean and comfortable, and the location perfectly located for our business at the capitol. just wish we could have stayed longer!"

your apartment was a sanctuary and it was so lovely to experience a capitol hill lifestyle. i'm a big fan of peregrine espresso now! 

really hope i get to come back to dc and stay with you again. "

safe residential neighborhood with easy access to restaurants and bars...mins from the metro...
micha was really friendly, nice and suggested lots of things to do in the area and in dc generally...and she also helped getting me a temporary parking permit....5 stars on everything..


she helped me get a temporary parking permit..."
382111,3633822,2013-02-26,2665690,Mercedes,"we had a great week  at micha""s apartment in capitol hill. the apartment was very spacious, clean, comfortable and very nicely furnished. micha and her husband were always helpful and available. ti also loved the neighborhood, with its beautiful old, houses while i was walking a few blocks to any of the two metro stations. i stayed with my 7 years old daughter that also liked it very much. i highly recommend this apartment and hope to be back myself. "
382111,3692277,2013-03-04,62339,Catalina,"welcome, wonderful brownies seem a tradition, and a very enjoyable one :) clean apartment, very nicely decorated. wonderful neighborhood. check out  peregrine espresso  close to eastern market metro station, ~5-10 walk from apt. thank you micha and brian!"
382111,3804880,2013-03-17,1630377,Rob,"had a great few days in this wonderful apartment.  tastefully decorated and well equipped -- and the arrival brownies were great.

very centrally located so getting around was easy,  just a few minutes walk to the metro.

definitely recommended. "
382111,4133601,2013-04-13,3153558,Ashley,"myself, my wife and three year old daughter stayed at micha's for five nights and it was great. the flat is well appointed with everything you need for a comfortable stay. it's only a short walk to capitol hill and to the top of the national mall. great restaurants on barracks row located not far away plus it's handy to the easten market and metro. i'd highly recommend staying at micha and brian's they are wonderful hosts!"
382111,4404451,2013-05-03,2026033,Simone,"it was another great stay with at micha and brian's apartment.  i stayed here exactly a year ago and it was like a homecoming.  they were very gracious and responsive when i forgot my key code, couldn't figure out how to use the tv/dvd and was cold. thanks again for a great stay!"
382111,4531169,2013-05-11,5493548,Christine,"micha was very friendly and helpful and always kept in contact.  we enjoyed the capitol hill area as it was so easy to walk everywhere and is a friendly and safe neighbourhood. the facilities - kitchen, bathroom were good, clean and well equipped and the lounge/dining area was spacious and homely.  this is a basement apartment so there is not very much natural light and because the bedroom is small, dark, at the rear of the apartment with a low ceiling we found this very claustrophobic for the two of us to sleep in.  however, the bed was comfortable.  the family area must be 
just above the bedroom, and as micha has a young family we were 
awoken early with heavy footsteps, and bangs from above the ceiling right over the bed."
382111,4645848,2013-05-18,1662849,Robert,"micha couldn't have been a better host. the location of the apartment couldn't have been much better. a short visitor's guide was available that explained everything.
the capital is about 4 blocks away with the metro a short walk also. grocery and drug stores are also convenient. 
internet and limited satellite television are provided along with about everything you might need except for food. 
street parking is available if you are driving to washington d.c.
overall, a very pleasant stay and highly recommended."
382111,4780120,2013-05-25,4152428,Megan,"this apartment was perfect for a short sightseeing trip to washington dc. it was clean, comfortable and micha even had a travel baby cot which made things easy for us.
it's a 15 minute walk from union station and also close to eastern market station which gets you to the national mall in minutes.
"
382111,4960056,2013-06-04,4759029,Maureen,"we stayed twice at micha's apartment and found it very comfortable and (website hidden by airbnb) is in a perfect location for walking around the capitol hill area and very near eastern market and the metro. micha was most  helpful and considerate and accommodated our odd timing of arrival and departure. we hope to return on our next dc visit. 
"
382111,5005252,2013-06-07,5298208,Daniel,"nice place, centrally located, comfortably housed four of us. neighborhood is quiet and the capitol and the national mall are within walking distance. a nice perk was the complimentary metro smart cards that could be easily loaded and used for the metro. altogether, we were very satisfied with our stay here."
382111,5230928,2013-06-19,6308052,Jenny,"lovely apartment, great location just a walking distance to the capitol. though i did not get to see micha coz' she was out of town during my stay but she was always keeping in touch with me by text. she provided us a lot of information on the places, train stations, grocery stores which were really helpful. we did enjoy our stay there. "
382111,5290875,2013-06-23,5628410,Kayleene,"micha's place in washington dc is very centrally located in a beautiful tree lined historic part of capitol hill. the apartment is really spacious and well equipped and perfect if travelling with a toddler. micha is really thoughtful and provides a portable cot, toys and some smartrip metro cards, maps and lonely planets to get you started. closest station is eastern market which has heaps of restaurants, organic market, pharmacy and other stores. all in all, a great place to stay!"
382111,5404128,2013-06-28,6842851,Dagmar,"we spent 3 nights in this wonderfully located appartment in washington and enjoyed it a lot! micha gave us a warm welcome although we were late and before arriving the communication was easy with very quick answers. our car could be parked in the street with a special license, that micha organized before - great! the appartment is fully equiped, very clean and comfortable and has a fine personal note. we loved it! highly recommanded, perfect for a pleasant stay in washington, i would shurely stay there again, if i ever get back. thanks a lot micha!!"

382111,6002464,2013-07-26,6221292,Melissa,"our stay in washington d.c. was great.  the apartment is located in a lovely area of the city within walking distance of the capital. the homes and gardens in the area are beautiful and unique. micha's apartment is cheery and bright with all the amenities of home. the bed and sofa bed were extremely comfortable and the kitchen has everything you'd need for meal preparation. we appreciated the many small touches such as the delicious plate of brownies, coffee maker with beans & grinder, parking permit, metro passes...the list goes on. we'd love to visit washington again in the future for a longer stay and would definitely stay in this apartment."
382111,6084227,2013-07-29,7406440,Raoul,"le basement de micha est idéalement situé dans le très jolie quartier de capitol hill, tout près du métro, d'un marché bio et d'excellent restaurants ( le meilleur étant le montmartre, restaurant français évidemment).c'est un quartier très préservé et très vert.l'appartement est très joli, bien équipé, convient à un couple avec un enfant.cependant il est un peu en sous sol( basement) donc pas très clair si on veut y rester la journée.
micha et sa famille habite juste au dessus ce qui est très pratique quand on a besoin de renseignements ou par exemple de faire garder ses valises avant de repartir.micha est une personne très sympathique et attentive aux voyageurs!
a mon avis c'est l'une des meilleures adresses à washington!
raoul"
382111,6200467,2013-08-03,2946718,Paul,"we had a great time in washington staying at micha's apartment in capitol hill. the apartment is very spacious in a good location and all our communication with micha was excellent. we were left three metro smart trip cards and a full set of instructions to help us navigate our way around washington, plus some welcoming brownies, which were delicious!
the only criticism we would have is that you have to walk through the bedroom to get to the bathroom, therefore the apartment may not be suitable for two couples. plus as this is a basement apartment the noise from the family home in the early morning can be heard and can wake you up!
overall we enjoyed our experience."
382111,6361596,2013-08-10,4806897,Colin,"we were lucky enough to stay here for a week with our two children (aged 5 & 7). micha's apartment is superbly located, in a lovely neighbourhood which has a very family feel to it. it's an ideal base for exploring washington, and micha is a very friendly and helpful host. 
the apartment itself is spacious, very clean and tidy, and has all the essentials. we'd be very pleased to stay here again, if we were to visit washington in the future."
382111,6460364,2013-08-13,695984,Nhu-An,"i reserved micha's place for my in-laws when they were visiting and they really enjoyed their stay.  it's a nice location on a shady street, convenient to metro and bus. the place is clean and the living area is spacious. it was a bit tricky for my elderly in-laws to get on the bed due to the position of the bed but no complaints otherwise.  would definitely reserve this place again when we have other out of town guests in the future."
382111,7195725,2013-09-10,7612902,Donald,"very clean, very comfortable bed, nicely located, easy to find & micha was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed.  we will use her again the next time we come to dc"
382111,7361412,2013-09-17,2151756,Jason,"great location.  nice place!  everything we needed for a very nice trip.  great proximity to museums, capitol, etc..  only slight criticisms- air conditioner in bedroom is a little noisy, and it doesn't have anywhere that you can hang out outside.  we had beautiful weather during our trip, and it would have been nice to have a spot to relax outside.  very nice place, though, and i would certainly recommend it!!!"
382111,7467892,2013-09-21,2096824,Suelyn,"misha was a gracious and communicative host. she was quick to respond to messages online, and during they stay she responded to all my texts."

382111,8018912,2013-10-13,7993907,Tanja,"we very much enjoyed staying in micha's apartement. we've been for 3 nights with 3 adults in her apartment. it was very nice decorated, clean, enough space for 3 adults, the sofabed is good as an extra bed. also the location of the apartment is in a very nice neighbourhood. subway is 10-15 minutes walks. grocery store and nice restaurants are also not far away. micha left metrocards to use which was very helpfull and nice. also micha is very quick answering emails which we very much appreciated. so all was very good and we would certainly recommend this apartment!!"
382111,8277262,2013-10-23,4343245,Maura,"micha's place is wonderful, and she couldn't be a more welcoming host!"
382111,8925553,2013-11-26,7793369,Clare,"i only have good things to say about micha's place. the location is fantastic and micha is a warm and generous host. we were two adults and two children, and while it was fairly tight, the space was very well organised, clean and well-supplied. the best thing is the location. being so close to the capitol meant that we could walk to many places. i went for jogs down the mall and around the capitol building, which was pretty magical. the laundry facilities are excellent and the bathroom facilities sufficed (nothing spectacular, but very adequate and no bathtub which my toddler regretted). i think that this place is excellent value for money, and would recommend micha's hospitality to anyone.

382111,9368750,2013-12-24,682317,Logan,very nice accommodations for three people. incredible location! lot's of light.  very good overall experience.
407014,1448315,2012-06-10,2085017,Angelle,"we had a very positive experience with the apptment near the white house mall. the place was very roomy for our family of 4 with comfortable bed , couch and air mattress( very easy to set up and take down.). very close to the metro and only 2 stops from the mall. for our family because there are 4 of us we paid the same price for a taxi as the metro at times because we were close to the downtown. the kitchen was very nice and although they didn't have all the tools i wanted they were glad to get them and were very quick to respond to any needs we had. 
it is a basement type suite and as a result only has widows in the front and they are not easy to see out of so it is not the place to stay if you want a view form home. they had just painted so it smelled a little of paint but i am sure that will fade. check in and out was very good and it was a secure place to stay. the paint smell and perhaps the lack of decor of any kind was the only things to keep it from being 5 star. the toilet was a little quirky and would not always flush everything the first time but it never plugged up and would work if you flushed again. "
407014,1481073,2012-06-14,391173,Tanya,"the remuzzi brothers have an incredibly good customer service orientation.  they are super responsive and take care of any issues that come up.  the apartment is central and very close to the metro/buses and is well priced.  plan on using public transport to get out and public transport or cabs to get back.  the washer/dryer and dishwasher as well as the nice silverware and fresh towels/sheets, were specially helpful."
407014,1592719,2012-06-30,2103198,Marla,"the stay at the apartment was great!  the location is very close to the metro and bus stop (a block away); thereore, you have easy access to transporation to the museums, etc. the communcation with the r brothers was very easy, they responded quickly to a concern we had, and it was taken care of. the aparment itself was very spacious and it kept us cool from the dc heat during our stay.  i would recommend staying here if you want the amenities of having your ""own"" place rather than a boring hotel room. :-)   "
407014,1634711,2012-07-05,2008479,Victor,very spacious basement apartment.  well located and very close to metro train and buses.  the brothers were very easy to deal with and gave a very good instruction list that also gave directions for transport and nearby restaurants etc.  we had 2 great nights at the nearby shaw tavern which was great spot to wind down after a day seeing the sights .  all amenities provided and excellent air conditioning for those hot days. beds very comfortable.
407014,1647430,2012-07-07,1676091,Judy,we very much enjoyed our stay in dc and the apartment . the remuzzi brothers were very helpful for our stay the apt was large and had great ac as dc was very hot. we would stay there again   judy destin florida
407014,1768452,2012-07-22,2466154,Cathleen,the apartment is a great location in dc!  the metro is just a couple blocks away and the recommended restaurants were great!  the remuzzi brothers are great with communication and always promptly responded to any questions i had.  i would definitely stay there again!
407014,1811601,2012-07-27,657213,Allison,"we stayed for almost a week while i attended a conference at the washington convention center.  apt was extremely convenient location for that venue -- easy 12 to 15 minute walk.  it's located in a gentrifying old dc neighborhood, which felt very safe.  we never bothered with the metro, as the location is quite walkable to many popular locations.  the apt is spacious and very well-equipped.  i had my husband and two teens and we fit very comfortably, using the sofa and queen air mattress in the living room.  the red toc restaurant, within sight, a block from the apt, was delicious, reasonably priced, and provided generous portions - perfect for late night take-out. the kids loved the big-screen tv.  i can't imagine paying big bucks for a dc hotel with this much more relaxing and spacious option available.  we'll surely be back. hosts were very responsive - even getting us a parking pass at the last minute when we forgot to ask for one in advance."
407014,1895088,2012-08-05,2873557,John,the apartment was great.  it was clean and comfortable.  the queen bed in the bedroom was very comfortable.  tons of extra linens and towels.  the unit boasted a nice kitchen and eating area.  overall a great value for the location and amenities.
407014,1932948,2012-08-09,1892626,Georgie,this was a good place to stay in dc for our family.  the apartment was very clean and within walking distance to subway station.  the kitchen with a dishwasher was a big plus; everything was there and in working order.  the pull-out sofa was great for our two kids to sleep on.  parking on the street was not a problem.  the remuzzi brothers were very professional from the beginning to the end.  we discovered that our parking permit was missing (previous occupant too it).  a phone call to the remuzzi brothers and they brought the permit right away.  highly recommended if you want to do your own cooking while on vacation. 
407014,2093630,2012-08-25,3201710,Laurence,we stayed 5 nights at the dc apartment with our family (3 children) and it was great. the apartment is in a walking distance from the capitole and downtown washington. we were able to use the public transport also with the metro very close. the apartment was clean and quite.
407014,2147582,2012-08-30,2644832,Sienara,"the remuzzi brothers are very professional. the place has everything you need, clean, neat, and the location is very convenient. they are also very accommodating. great place, great stay! "
407014,2178595,2012-09-03,2356532,Richard,"not a bad apartment in an area just about walkable to the main sites, but rather disappointing compared with what we got in boston and new york.
although we booked and paid extra for being six people the apartment was not really set up for six. only five chairs around the dining table. took us ages to find the airbed. 
the area was not great, the 7-11 nearby was positvely scary. 
we are pretty layback about security, but for those who worry more the only external lock being in effect a four digit combination code might be a bit unsettling. 
only getting instructions sent to us a week before was a pain as we never got a chance to print them out, and i kept on having to look things up on the ipad, which was a bit of a pain.
we were not allowed to leave our bags in teh house until 3pm, instead being asked to store them in the back yard (under cover), which seemed a bit petty, although it was within the terms made clear when we booked.
all in all it seemed a lot of money for what we got, but that is probably a reflection on washington rents more than the property itself. "
407014,2261148,2012-09-11,2807122,Janice,the remuzzi brothers dc apt met all our needs both at their place as well as our travelling to and from dc via public transportation.  the location showed our children a very multi-cultural aspect to the dc neighbourhood.  a preventative inquiry to them during our stay  received a very quick response from one of the brothers.  we would definitely consider returning and referring their place to friends.
407014,2301161,2012-09-17,2873993,Karima,"this spacious basement apartment is conveniently close to the metro and has a washer/dryer and well-equipped kitchen for cooking at home. the bed is comfortable, ac works great, and the owners are easy to reach with questions.  upstairs tenants were pleasant and helpful, and rental car parking was easy to find on the street nearby.
the metro is great; plan to drive as little as possible, dc traffic is crazy!"
407014,2350883,2012-09-20,1286024,Santiago,"the house is perfect, very big and so confortable. very clean, very good location, and prepared to receive the tourist (with maps, guides, etc.). good experience."
407014,2382336,2012-09-23,3358339,David,"ticked all our boxes! good location to the metro (shaw), supermarket opposite metro,  area felt safe, apartment had cctv on both entrances.
kitchen was a big bonus and bed settee was fine for two adults. good to be able to rent for three nights/4 days only and we felt this was enough to enjoy the best of washington.

as this was our first move from hotels to apartments when visiting for a city break, we will certainly try this again"
407014,2494541,2012-10-03,3043132,Ivan,"the apartment is really nice, everything was just as described. the location is good too, close to a subway station and in a peaceful area. also, the remuzzi brothers were always very attentive and quick to answer to any of my doubts."
407014,2535296,2012-10-08,2565637,Caryn,"the apartment was spacious and located conveniently near the metro, highway and tourist sites.  communications with trbs was timely.  we had a great time in dc!"

407014,2684668,2012-10-22,2233565,Adrianna,"i was in town with a couple of my friends for homecoming and had an absolute blast!!!  the location was amazing close to u street, restuarants, and the metro!!  there was ample space for us, we couldn't figure out how the blow up bed worked, but hey we didn't need it!  i could not ask for anything more!

thanks guys!"
407014,2768697,2012-10-31,3294693,Guillermo,"we enjoyed our stay in washington hosted at the remuzzi brothers dc apartment.  the apartment is very comfortable and has many facilities that made easier our days there.  the kitchen is very complete; they supply enough  linen (sheets and towels).   good ligths, blanquets and pillows and in general is  very well equipped  and is very near to the white house mall and to the metro train station. and the most important for us, they(trb) were available for help us during a need we had during the hurracaine sandy, which happened during our stay."
407014,2847987,2012-11-10,2718254,Heidi,"this was my first experience using airbnb and i'm glad i did!  the apartment was mostly how i expected it to be.  convenient location, safe neighborhood, and lots of room.
the remuzzi brothers did a great job at attending to one minor concern my friend and i had.  i hope to always have hosts so attentive and willing to help!"
407014,2883369,2012-11-13,918374,Lauren,the reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.
407014,2883870,2012-11-14,2472572,Melinda,"thanks for having us. we enjoyed the space for our family to spread out and the lovely walks down to wholefoods for groceries, coffee and cake! we also used the metro each day and loved convenience of the shaw station just around the corner."
407014,3012577,2012-12-03,1757258,Axel,"we found it practical for what we needed to do in dc and a better deal than a hotel. the kitchen is new and the best part of the appartment, the rest is ok for a couple of nights, though, compared to my other bnb experiences, not that new. internet worked only sporadically fine and always too slow from living room. i found it good that you can check-in and out alone. the living room can be a bit loud during the night and early hours. the flat is very spacious and is good that we had an iron, washing machine, etc. nrighborhood seemed not the most secure place to walk alone in the night, but in groups we did not feel insecure. the hosters were very king and responsive via email. i would repeat this bnb."
407014,3132579,2012-12-22,2931619,Elaine,"very good central location in washington dc. we were able to walk to all the key attractions. kitchen and laundry facilities excellent, very clean and we enjoyed our stay. good communication from the hosts and detailed information provided of the location attractions and shopping facilities, which proved helpful."

407014,3171551,2012-12-28,2862516,Kevin,cosy and fairly priced accommodation. my mates and myself loved the self check-in system and a sense of safety and privacy the apartment offered. good security system with door locks and security cameras made our first stay in dc very very comfortable. the lounge room was a great place to hang out and chill after a long day out site seeing. kitchen was new and had everything you needed to survive if you chose not to eat out at a decent selection of restaurants close by. the highlight of our trip would definitely be the capitol bike rentals which is only a block away next to shaw library.
407014,3205809,2013-01-01,3652757,Mitzi,"very accomodating, prompt responses to questions and issues. "
407014,3277282,2013-01-05,1789929,Katie,"one of the best airbnb experiences i've had, such a great place, clean, roomy, warm and secure. super easy check in and out too. loved the restauran, bar and transport tips they were very helpful!"
407014,3405530,2013-01-24,1750288,Denise,"i had the pleasure of staying here during inauguration weekend and it was absolutely perfect.  the location gives you the opportunity to get anywhere in downtown d.c. within minutes.  there's a metro station within 2 blocks, or you can opt for a cab ride to get you there even quicker.  

the self check-in/check-out was easy, and the apartment is exactly as it looks in the photo album.  (it's actually a lot bigger than i thought it would be.)  the check-in package they send when you book the apartment lists multiple food options, metro stations, bus stops, and cab company phone numbers, and there's a shelf in the living room with all kinds of brochures and maps of the city and its neighborhoods.

the remuzzi brothers were easy to contact, very thorough in their instructions, and all in all great invisible hosts.

"
407014,3443815,2013-01-30,2383433,John,i enjoyed the stay. the unit was close to the metro and the check in/out was easy and efficient.

407014,3655827,2013-02-28,2794575,Giels,it was great to stay at the apartment of the remuzzi brothers. everything we needed was provided and because we had a rescheduled flight we were even able to store our bags later that day. i can really advise you to stay at their place when you'll visit washington. these guys even have a great manual with places to go to in dc. 
407014,3712991,2013-03-07,590369,Peter,"just as described!  great responsive hosts.  clean, convenient, great kitchen, nice to have full size washer and dryer.  we'll probably stay here again next time in d.c."
407014,3734336,2013-03-09,371872,Bruno,booked the place only 2 hours before arriving and everything was super nice. the bothers are more than amazing and they care about their guests. 100% recommended for y'all looking a place to stay in town.
407014,3779327,2013-03-14,1360811,Steven,"on the whole, the place worked out well.  the host did everything that they promised and the place was as described.  it was in a very convenient location.  the space was very functional.  the host provided a nice summary in advance of the visit and made it very convenient to use.

the drawbacks were that the location was very close to a not so nice part of town.  kind of transitional area within a couple of blocks of a tougher area.  also, the place could have been a touch cleaner and some things were in disrepair.

i would consider staying there again but would look hard at finding a little nicer neighborhood even if it cost a bit more."
407014,3813219,2013-03-18,4232673,Lisa,great hosts and great location. would definitely stay there again.

407014,4135136,2013-04-13,5119809,Ann,"very spacious apartment, clean and comfortable.  located a short walk from subway with easy access to the sights of washington dc.  we found the information regarding local bars and restaurants useful.  easy access to the apartment, detailed check-in information received well before our stay.  would recommend staying here to friends"
407014,4213440,2013-04-19,5397651,Katrin,"its a great place and i would go there again. the description how to check in was very accurate and helpful, the apartment clean and all was there what we needed. 
the bed is amazing comfortable, i wanted to take it home with me ! the apartment is in the basement with not so much natural light in some rooms, but for a few days its fine. 
we ate out at the recommanded thai restaurant and shaws tavern and liked it both. you could sit outside at both places to enjoy the food. 
to lock the place when we went out was a bit tricky, but we figured out somehow , how it worked. "
407014,4266297,2013-04-23,229837,Justine (And Bob),"good location with a short walk to the metro.  manual was helpful with instructions for entering the unit and it was a plus to have a parking permit.  instructions for the tv for non cable user subscribers would be helpful as well for the thermastat.

i would recommend for a short stay.  lower level is dark and feels closed in.  having the security camera was great.  felt safe although the neighborhood is worth extra precautions.  kitchen was very adequate.  thank you for the coffee.

the r brothers are very responsive.  thanks."

407014,4401578,2013-05-03,3397061,Aurélie,"nous avons passé à 4 un super séjours dans cet appartement. il est spacieux, propre et contient tout le nécessaire pour la toilette, la lessive, le couchage.
le quartier est calme et proche du centre. pas mal de petits restos très bons dans le coin (dont le beau thai).
très appréciable, l'énorme machine à laver et l'énorme sèche-linge.!!!
je recommande vivement cet appartement.

merci aux remuzzi brothers pour autant d'attention envers leurs locataires.

407014,4469111,2013-05-07,4072092,Jean-Michel,"we had a great time in this apartment. it is well maintained, clean and very comfortable. the bed is perfect! good point for the washing machine and dryer. and it was very easy to park nearby. 
everything is perfectly planned by the remuzzi brothers. in addition, washington is really a beautiful city!

nous avons passé un très agréable moment dans cet appartement. il est parfaitement entretenu, propre et très confortable. le lit est parfait ! bon point pour la machine à laver et le sèche linge. il a été très facile de se garer à proximité. aucun problème à signaler, les remuzzi brothers avaient tout prévu. en plus, washington est vraiment une ville magnifique !"
407014,4513688,2013-05-10,3564049,Steve,"this place is great - easy to access ($20 from the airport & 5 minutes from the local subway stop) & is perfect for a holidaying couple.  lovely big bedroom with a very comfy bed, great kitchen (including lots of condiments) with seperate dining area, dishwasher, washing machine & dryer (great for us as we'd been travelling for 2 weeks already & needed to do some washing), big tv & excellent selection of brochures with things to do/see, local places to eat & bars to visit (several of which we did & had a ball).

although at the ""top end"" of town, washington is not a ""big city"" so if you don't mind walking you can walk from the apartment to most of the tourist attractions (white house, lincoln momorial, capital building, smithsonian, etc) & arlington cemetary & george town are less than 30 minutes on the subway (which is also easy to use).

the rem bros were easy to contact & very helpful - both before we left oz & after we got to the states. joe even came over & fixed the tv when this dopey aussie stuffed it up at 10pm on our first night!

can't recommend this place highly enough - do yourself a favour & stay here if you are in washington!"

407014,7010030,2013-09-03,7185020,Raghavendran,"good: 
- the apartment is centrally located and just minutes away from all the major attractions. there are lots of shops and restaurants nearby. the locality was very safe at night as well.
- very detailed move-in instructions was given and the whole process was very smooth.
- we were able to find parking spot right next to the house every day and the parking permit provided by remuzzi brothers really helped.
- the kitchen was well equipped with what we wanted.
- the bed and bath linens were clean.
- the bedroom was really comfortable.

what could have been better:
- we found at least a couple(2-3) insects/bugs crawling on the carpet in the living room as we entered the apartment.
- the apartment is definitely not big enough to accommodate 6 people. two of us had to sleep in the dinning room(by kitchen). 
- my dad and brother who slept in sectional also complained that they at times felt insects crawling on them at night.
"
407014,7194198,2013-09-10,6770843,Kyle,"headline: overall, the stay was functional and served its purpose, but the apartment is disappointing compared to what was advertised in the photos. 
the good: service and communication by remuzzi bros was excellent - they provided everything we needed in advance of the stay and were very responsive to our questions. everything about check-in was as described and we had no problems at all. the apartment was well stocked with the essentials with very clear instructions for all the amenities, all of which were in good working order (brand new washer/dryer unit was very convenient). the shaw area just a couple of blocks away is a little sketchy, but we felt safe walking to the metro with our kids. people on the street were friendly. parking was easy right in front of the apartment on 6th street.
now for the 2-star rating: the apartment is not in good shape, so much so that we don’t believe the online photos are a fair representation of the unit. the carpets, especially in the living room, are stained and soiled, with a disturbing smell. we didn't let our 6yo and 2yo crawl around on the floor. the whole place could use a fresh coat of paint, but with proper surface prep (versus just slapping another coat of paint on what appears to be several layers of cover-up work). it could use a very thorough cleaning as well - especially a thorough carpet shampoo/stain treatment and clean inside the cabinets. the shower curtain rod was very rusted and the shower curtain moldy. the lighting in the bedroom is dim and overall very dreary.  besides two end tables in the bedroom there is only one, very small rickety table.  there was no dresser to put our belongings in.  the closet in the bedroom is well lit, but really run down.  the bed linens were clean and comfortable. the air conditioning unit is quite loud (causing our 6yo to rate this a 2-star because the a/c kept her awake).  you can only set the a/c to a minimum of 68 degrees, comfortable for us, but maybe not for everyone. for the price, the place really needs to be spruced up.
my wife and i agreed it could be a great place for budget-minded and adventurous travelers but really needs some tlc to match what is advertised online.

407014,7327482,2013-09-16,7282060,Svetlana,"our stay in dc was wonderful! the house has everything you can think of, and even more. our 3 kids slept on the sofa and on the air mattresses (actually they have 2 excellent double air mattresses and double sofa, so the house could sleep up to 8 people, the single problem is there is no place to move when you set up all the beds).
when we arrived, there was no promised parking permit in the house (probably the fault of the previous guest), so we called the hosts, and in the end they brought temporary permit for our car, but it took time (around 3 hours). so i'd recommend, if you plan using a car and you need parking permit - check earlier to be sure the permit is on its place!"
407014,7502479,2013-09-23,4173814,Laurel,"beautiful apartment, easy check in and out. just a 5 min walk from the shaw/howard uni metro, or the convention center (and safeway). we thoroughly enjoyed our 5 nights here and would stay again! thanks, guys!

"
407014,7665801,2013-09-29,1718295,Campbell,"the remuzzi brothers apartment in shaw area was very good. spacious, very comfortable king size bed, great setup in the kitchen with everything needed to self cater. washer and dryer were excellent. we had a great base to see dc and there are great restaurants close by. the metro is 5minutes walk and was a great way to get around. we'd definitely stay again next time in dc"
407014,7763013,2013-10-01,456408,Chris,"my girlfriend and i spent 3 nights in this awesome apartment; centrally located to everything we were hoping to see & do in washington dc.  the unit was very spacious, which was a nice surprise once we entered through the back garden.  large kitchen & dining area along with a living room that could comfortably host all our friends.  the apartment was super clean with all the amenities you'd have at home, clean towels, extra blankets, and kitchen supplies.  the floors & carpet were well maintained with a cool city-style bathroom that breaks up the space nicely.    

we drove down as part of a road trip and were pleasantly surprised with the amount of available parking not to mention a parking pass waiting for us once we checked-in.  once parked & unloaded for the weekend, we did not move our car from the parking spot right in-front of the apt.  the metro is 2 blocks away and it was an easy stroll into chinatown & then down to the national mall to checkout all the sites.  this was key for our city adventure.    

the remuzzi brothers were super attentive to all our needs throughout the weekend.  they suggested several great new restaurants, cafes, & taverns all within walking distance to the apartment.  we headed downtown a couple times and easily hailed a cab right on rhode island.  fast wifi, hd cable, all integrated with their security system was also a really nice touch that made us feel right at home.  

my girlfriend and i have used airbnb a few times now and i must say this unit definitely hits the mark.  we were more than pleased with our stay and would recommend to any friends/family planning a visit into dc.  

thanks again to the remuzzi brothers.  
"
407014,7806108,2013-10-04,5791549,Jo,"our first stay with airbnb, we will definitely do it again! from the very first communication with the remuzzi brothers we were super impressed. they replied quickly, helped us when we accidentally booked the wrong dates and answered any questions we had. the check in documents were so detailed, and were very helpful to us aussies! the apartment had tourist information, and the remuzzi brothers had supplied all sorts of information, including restaurants, shopping, transport... the list goes on! the apartment was clean and well set up, with plenty of towels/blankets. anything we needed was already supplied. thanks remuzzi brothers! "
407014,7900328,2013-10-07,3345713,Eric,"i cannot offer enough superlatives for the above and beyond service we received from the remuzzi brothers. it is one thing to deliver excellent service when everything goes right, but quite another to deliver excellent service in the face of challenges. for our stay, there was a mix-up with housekeeping and the housekeepers failed to prepare the apartment. the remuzzi brothers proactively recognized the error and reached out to us during our stay to correct the issue. they had the apartment cleaned while we were out and offered a refund for our troubles. when we had difficulty processing the refund on the website, the remuzzi brothers diligently pursued the promised refund for nearly 2 weeks! yes, the apartment is very nice and the location is great, but i recommend staying with the the remuzzi brothers because they will do everything within their power to make your stay great. this is airbnb at its best! "
407014,7977452,2013-10-11,6439755,Sue,"we enjoyed our stay at the remuzzi brothers' apartment.  loved the self-check in process.  it was easy and well communicated.  very nice to not have to coordinate schedules to gain entry.  unfortunately, our main reason for visiting dc (for the first time) was to visit the smithsonian - but were unable due to the government shut down - but we toured the city and made the most of our time there.  the remuzzi brothers were wonderfully easy to communicate with and were extremely expedient in replying to all our questions about getting around, etc.  "
407014,8053489,2013-10-14,8886064,Kira,"we were 5 people to stay at this apartment. the hosts were really kind, and let us do early check in, and late checkout for no additional charge. 

the apartment comes with everything you need, towels, linen, blankets, pillows, shampoo, conditioner and soap. also there is a washer, dryer and a dish washer. the kitchen is well equipped with coffee, tea, sugar and other basics and of course dishes. the only thing we didn't like was the sofa bed, which was not very comfortable to sleep on, but not to worry, there was another air mattress which is of very good quality (comes up to a full size and height bed), so one couple slept in the bed room, and the other 3 slept in the living room on air mattresses. 

the apartment was clean (trash can was full, but we just emptied it out back).

the apartment is close to everywhere and everything (despite the fact we were here during the shutdown, so everything was closed). very easy access to the metro, the airport, and union station."
407014,8174368,2013-10-19,1808237,Kelly,"the apartment was clean and comfortable and easy to get into per the brothers' directions. i made the mistake of forgetting to return the keys upon leaving the morning of check-out and thankfully my friend was able to drop them off for me.

she met one of the brothers and said he was very nice. i appreciate their understanding!"
407014,8280547,2013-10-23,8288377,Bonnie,overall a really good place that's close to the train for fast transportation. not too far a walking distance to some great wine bars and dive bars. everything in the place had instructions like using the washer and dryers. note to those looking to stay... read all the pdf you get from the brothers. we missed the part about throwing out trash and throwing sheets in the washer before leaving.
407014,8403619,2013-10-29,2837306,Megan,"we had a great trip in dc. the shaw metro is less than a 5 min walk to the apartment. also, we were able to take the yellow line directly from reagan airport. the apartment is more north of the capitol and national mall than i realized. but that didn't matter since we mostly traveled the metro. the apartment is clean and well kept. the area a little north by the metro can get a little seedy at night but nothing bad, i just wouldn't walk around alone. the apartment is very secure with security cameras as well. the couch pull out is comfortable and so is the bed. our main purpose for the trip was the marine corps marathon. being further out was great for getting on the metro, because it wasn't packed yet and we were able to sit and ride the yellow line all the way to the pentagon. the only complaint we had was the noise upstairs. hearing people walking around is not a big deal. the only problem was that we tried to go to bed early on a saturday night due to getting up early for the marathon the next day and the people above were having a halloween party until about 2am. so that got a little irritating but i'm sure it's not a usual occurrence. 

thanks for a great stay!!!"
407014,8610856,2013-11-08,249186,Laila,"i made this booking in behalf of my co-worker who is new to airbnb.  trbs made the process very smooth and straightforward from my initial inquiry. here's what the guests had to say:
this was the first time my husband and i used airbnb, and what a great first experience we had! we stayed at the the remuzzi brother's apartment, and had a great time in dc! i was attending a conference at the convention centre, so it was really nice having a home base that was clean, with a kitchen, supplies (like towels, cutlery, shampoo..) laundry facilities, free wifi and a comfy living area for us to come and go. 
the location was perfect for what we wanted to do and see in dc. 10min walk to the convention centre (which was handy for me), very close to a metro station (which was very easy to navigate), and even some local eateries within walking distance. 
the first night i arrived, i had a bit of difficulty with the lock on the front door, i contacted one of the brother's, and he kindly took the time to walk me through over the phone. much appreciated :)
i could keep the list going... but i think you're getting the point. this is a great place to stay in the city. i would highly recommend it to anyone, and hopefully we'll come back some day! 
thank you!! ~hayley and kyle

407014,8743773,2013-11-15,6399948,Florence,"nous sommes très contents d'avoir séjournés dans cet appartement. il est très bien situé, à 10 min à pieds du métro. le quartier est calme et joli (les maisons changent du dc touristique). la cuisine, bien que nous n'en ayons pas eu l'utilité, est superbe et très bien équipée. il y a une vidéo surveillance qui rassure. le lit est confortable. cependant, betit bémol, la climatisation/chauffage est très très bruyante, nous avons du l'éteindre pour pouvoir dormir. 
la salle de bain est certes étroite mais fonctionnelle.
il y a également une autorisation de stationnement qui à washington se révèle très pratique.
nous n'avons pas vu nos hôtes, mais ils nous ont fourni toutes les informations nécessaires avant notre arrivée (sur le logement, sur la ville, les transports... ). un grand merci à eux !"
407014,8844165,2013-11-21,7691906,Matias,"my second time using airbnb, i stayed with 2 friends in november, the apartment has everything we needed and more, it was very comfy and cozy. we've had a great time in washington d.c., thank you guys!"
407014,8896675,2013-11-25,513621,Garrett,"the remuzzi brothers are the most prepared and comprehensive guests i've had through the airbnb process. i couldn't think of one thing that they'd forgotten (from an iron and coffee to bath products and an incredibly detailed check-in/out sheet). i also loved the shaw/howard neighborhood. it was very historic with some nice places to eat, walk, and drink. "
407014,9068856,2013-12-04,9174451,Olof,we (5 adults) stayed at the dc apartment for 5 nights and where very comfortable. the apartment has everything you need for a good vacation and is located near the subway which is only a 10 min walk from the apartment. we felt safe walking around and it was easy to get a taxi on the corner and the bus stop is only couple of blocks away. the remuzzi brothers answered all our questions and where very willing to help us find what we needed. the self in check form they have is very easy to use and has a load of information that came in handy. we would definitely stay there again. 
409582,1120723,2012-04-12,221182,Rob,"i used to live not far from this apartment, so i knew the neighborhood well. it was nice to see just how much the area has changed. the bike rental is an amazing addition to the area, for example. i don't ride, but it's helpful to have. 

even if this flat hadn't been as nice as it actually was, its location alone would have made it absolutely awesome. i have read the reviews that people write on this and similar sites where people say the flat is located in x area, but the reality is that it's in y area. that is not the case here. it is ridiculously close to the metro, which came in handy when i couldn't control myself shopping at various malls, and also when i spent the morning on the national mall doing an incredible amount of walking. knowing that i was almost in the door as i ascended in the escalator was a very good thing. 

another thing that i read a lot on reviews here is the facility with which they can connect to the internet. again, it was painless. my netbook connected with absolute ease. 

[my main laptop didn't, but that was *my* problem, as i had forgotten just how locked down to my home network it was. if you have a laptop that is extremely customised to your home network, remember to unlock it before traveling.]

the fireplace in the apartment worked, which is a very nice touch. there was wood available, and i caught up on some last-minute work while tending a nice warming fire. the early spring nighttime temperatures were what most northeasterners would call mild, but seven years in cape town has made me a bit of a weather wimp -- spring temps in washington was basically mid-winter capetonian weather, and it was nice to have the fire, which was also nice to sit in front of while watching television [and, since this matters on airbnb, the tv does come with cable].

there's a washer and dryer, which is also a good thing, and an obscene amount of closet space if you are, like me, someone who likes to properly unpack clothing when on holiday. 

all in all, this is an excellent place, and i would highly recommend it."
409582,1133864,2012-04-15,1605121,Kelly,"four days before our trip to dc, our original airbnb host had to cancel.  we were scrambling to find a place to stay and kelly emailed me back almost immediately!  he was always great with emailing back quickly before we got there.  

he went out the night before we got there to get a lockbox which was incredibly helpful so we could ""check-in and out"" easily.  

the location of the apartment is perfect!!!  you're literally across from the metro and just down the street from tons of restaurants, bars, the capitol building and the mall, and nationals park.  kelly was great too at recommending places to go and giving info on getting to the airport, etc.

the apartment is stocked with everything you could possibly need and the one thing that wasn't (a hair dryer) they went and picked up immediately, which was amazing!  the bed (and the futon!) were both super comfortable.

the apartment is in the basement of their gorgeous old rowhouse, so you will hear some floorboards creaking and the water running, but that just adds to the charm!

next time we are in dc, we hope to be able to stay with them again!"
409582,1189018,2012-04-27,340289,Melissa,"first, kelly was great with pre-trip communication. there's a lockbox out front which makes it very convenient as our check in was in the evening. the awesome clean/efficient dc metro stop is right across the street. it's so convenient. even with tired children, they can make it ""home"" from the subway after a day of touring. there is a puppy park/playground literally one block away and another playground one block past that one. the neighborhood is beautiful with lovely walks right around the corner. the eastern market is a few blocks away and my kids and i loved being able to go there in the morning for great bakery goodies and food shopping needs and the weekend flea market is really fun. so dc and cool to see it was started ny thomas jefferson! there is a great toy story by there and gelato ice cream. the capitol area is just blocks away and the mall is only a few metro stops away. the apt is so cozy! the fireplace was wonderful and kelly alwasy kept the wood well stocked out back. there is a sweet sitting area out front which my friend and i enjoyed after the kids passed out early from all the touring/walking. kelly was incredible with communication if ever i needed anything. the kitchen is perfectly stocked with cooking supplies and a yes organics food shop is around the corner which had great stuff especially for snacks for the day (which of course i had to throw out at the capitol tour and the white house!...fyi read fine print for these tours!)
so i encourage anyone looking for a great place in dc to try and book this place. the bed was so comfortable that it was the best sleep i've had in ages...even with my two little ones i couldn't wait to sink in there. the laundry was great for me to have as well. there are no drawbacks at all...wish i could of stayed longer and look forward to coming back again (since i had a rained out ballgame and still have senate gallery passes to use!) if there's availability!"
409582,1211605,2012-05-01,2111362,Blake,"what a terrific weekend my husband and i had at dc's eastern market area!  kelly was extremely helpful and responsive to all inquiries and needs.  staying in the garden apartment was not only more convenient than a hotel but also a much better ""experience"".  we could walk to terrific restaurants, enjoy the eastern market shopping,and take advantage of all the benefits staying in such a well located apartment provided.  kelly checked in with us after we arrived and made himself available for any questions or concerns.  highly recommend the boxcar cafe across from the eastern market for brunch and dinner!  many thanks to kelly for making our trip to dc most enjoyable!!!  "
409582,1226674,2012-05-04,2003429,Katherine,"kelly went above and beyond to make our trip to washington dc pleasant, efficient and enjoyable. i rented the apartment on behalf of two artist friends from out of town, and kelly went the extra mile to provide tailored suggestions for them. it left an incredible impression of hospitality and generosity. the apartment is cozy and outfitted with every convenience of home, and small touches of a boutique hotel. the location next to the metro stop is incredibly convenient! "
409582,1248917,2012-05-08,1841019,Charlton  (Dee),kelly was a great host. personable and informative.  apartment completely equiped (even a beer in fridg). metro 1/2 block (direct to center of capitol mall) or you can walk one block and look down the street and see capitol building. great casual dining and restraurant scene within a few blocks (7th and 8th streets). eastern market open daily and a farmers market and faire on  weekends (two blocks).  stores (even a fedx) within a block.  our whole experience was great and we would definately stay here again when returning to dc.  thanks kelly!
409582,1522374,2012-06-20,2124026,Darrell,"check in was easy, the place was as promised, and the location was great - easy access to the metro, and great restaurants nearby. kelly was easy to get a hold of, and very accommodating. my family had a great time in dc, and a great place to crash after we were worn out after 8+ hours of museums. i would definitely stay here again."
409582,1554480,2012-06-25,1431634,Shannon,"we were quite comfortable in kelly's apartment in eastern market. the apartment was a good size for a family of three. it had all the amenities we needed to enjoy our stay. we were able to eat breakfast and prepare bag lunches before heading out to enjoy the sites of dc. the apartment is also very conveniently located, across the street from a metro stop but also walking distance to capital hill. kelly was available to answer any questions we had and provided a helpful binder of information."

lovely little apartment ideally located (metro, market, parks) and featuring everything you need for a nice time in dc. kelly's 100% e-planning is very efficient. he offers tips to enjoy the flat and the neighbourhood. though the appartment has only 1 bedroom, it was big enough for our family of 6, as our kids are still young. have a pleasant stay !"

i found the apartment well appointed, clean and very easy to stay at. it is a short travel on the bus or metro into downtown dc and i chose to walk in a number of time which i found pleasant and a good way to take in the area..

kelly is very good and communicates well. he provides great information on the area. i would certainly recommend kelly. if you're going to dc, this is the aprtment you want.

would recommend highly.  "
409582,2742978,2012-10-29,100034,John,"you would be hard pressed to find a more comfortable and affordable  place in a more convenient spot than this. eastern market is  beautiful  with many great shops and restaurants and the apartment is on one of the neighborhood's quiet and pretty side streets and within a stone's throw of the metro. it is also nicely appointed and was a cozy retreat for the four of us  (two parents, two boys 11 and 13) during our long weekend there. what's more, kelly's hospitality and attention to detail is phenomenal. he arranged metro passes for us and we had use of his bikeshare account, which allows you to ride community bikes from various pickup and drop off locations. he and his young family are right up stairs but we were so busy we never crossed paths. we had the misfortune of our vacation coinciding with hurricane sandy and when it forced us to alter our travel plans, kelly worked with us to make it as painless as possible.

409582,2805557,2012-11-05,2691070,Allegra,"we had a great stay. kelly was very attentive. the apartment was well equipped, comfortable and very well situated for visiting dc. we found his book of tips very helpful, especially the lists of stores and restaurants  we will recommend it to all our friends."

409582,3084016,2012-12-13,4317502,Virginia,"we truly enjoyed our stay at this eastern market apartment.  it was clean, fully functional, and a great price.  metro cards and bike share options were available, and we were able to park right out front with a parking pass from kelly!  we were within eye sight (across the street) from the metro, and able to walk or bike anywhere because we were in the middle of everything.  kelly and jack were both available for whatever we needed, and we stayed in constant contact from reservations through the stay.  the apartment was underneath the home of 5, so early mornings while they weregetting ready and out the door the noise was noticed.  other than that all was wonderful and we would recommend this location to others."
409582,3177542,2012-12-29,1039881,Marge,"awesome location! best in dc, in my opinion, when it comes to mobility, transportation options (even driving from this location is easy), restaurants, daily needs (market, pharmacy, dog park, just a block away), site seeing, etc. kelly is an amazing host. fully stocked kitchen, everything you could ever need. you can hear the family upstairs, but its a joyous sound. we enjoyed our stay immensely.

409582,3221585,2013-01-02,4143152,Joseph,"great location. easy access to restaurants on 8th street and eastern market metro. kelly did a great job staying in touch, even though he was out of town, and had metro passes waiting for us."
409582,3332944,2013-01-12,2947743,Anne Marie,"my husband, dog, and i were moving from california to dc and needed a place to stay temporarily while waiting for our new home and household goods to be ready.  we stayed in kelly's apartment for a week and loved it.  after a lot of time on the road and living out of suitcases, it was wonderful to feel at home.  

the apartment is very comfortable and the kitchen is well-equipped.  we were so thankful to have the opportunity to cook after far too much road food.  the extra amenities such as the tv with access to netflix was great when needing to unwind.  and you just can't beat the location - everything is at your door step.  

kelly was extremely easy to communicate with and responded immediately to emails.  the binder they have put together with tips and information is extremely helpful and answers any question we may have had.

i would recommend this apartment to anyone.  if you are coming to dc, this is the place to stay."
409582,3400090,2013-01-23,6236,Joy,"5 stars isn't enough for this place!

kelly offers a great place in a fantastic location for any trip to dc! we came for inauguration events, and found the location could not be beat. so convenient to metro and a great neighborhood with restaurants, great shops (don't miss hill's kitchen). the neighborhood was family-friendly, clean and safe.

kelly is a super host who pays attention to all the details. he provided valuable information before and during our stay... even responding to last-minute questions and offering referrals to local businesses/resources as needed. and he's thought of just about anything you may need to know in his comprehensive tips & tricks book. with kelly, i really felt like i had a friend i could count on if i needed anything during the trip. that was a nice bonus.

the place was clean, the bed was firm and i slept like a log. love the ""nesting"" thermostat, simple instructions about recycling and composting, handy toiletries and the weekend delivery of the washington post! 

everything was great, and you simply cannot beat this location for a great base from which to explore all of dc!"
409582,3445807,2013-01-31,3271527,Robin,"this is a very comfortable apt with a perfect location for touring dc. everything you could need is included. great kitchen and bath, cozy living and dining room. the washer/dryer were a plus, too!!  our friends that were staying nearby were jealous...and want to stay here on their next trip!"

409582,3599438,2013-02-22,4376271,Meredith,we had a great experience! kelly was so helpful and accommodating. and the space is perfect located right next to the eastern market metro.
409582,3667650,2013-03-02,4656871,Ellen,"kelly and jack are wonderful hosts, and attend to all of your needs!!!  the apartment is very comfortable and cozy.  the location is perfect; eastern market is so close and it's such fun to go every morning to buy fresh eggs, butter, cheeses, meat, produce, etc. you have everything you need in the area--great restaurants, supermarket, cleaners, pharmacy, etc. having the metro across the street from the apartment is ideal!!  if you have a car, you can almost always find parking in front of the apartment, and kelly and jack provide you with a parking pass, a metro/bus/bicycle pass, and so many other things that make your time there so easy and convenient.  i hope we can stay in this wonderful apartment again soon!!!!"

"
409582,3958389,2013-03-31,4709875,Amanda,"this was our first experience with airbnb and we had a fantastic experience. kelly held my hand and patiently answered all of my questions. we were traveling with 2 small children and it was both the perfect place to do so - down to the set of plastic bowls and cups specifically for them. they truly are located right across from the metro and after a long day of sightseeing, we were able to come right back with very little walking. the extras that they provide like the metro cards and the list of restaurants really do go above and beyond. staying here you really do get a feel for living in a dc neighborhood rather than just staying in a hotel."
409582,4039862,2013-04-05,4134332,Sam,"our family loved the eastern market apartment. the apartment itself was lovely and cozy, and the proximity to the metro was stellar. having the eastern market, 8th street restaurants and stores, two playgrounds and all the other places within walking distance was wonderful. our children absolutely enjoyed the freedom of not being strapped in to a carseat, and we almost forgot to see all the wonderful sights of washington."
409582,4441819,2013-05-06,1671031,Susan,"i had the best time at kelly and jack's place, which is clean and comfortable and located in a great part of town. they were both so welcoming and friendly. the apartment had everything i was looking for, and eastern market is a fabulous neighborhood. there are lots of restaurants and a flea market (and food market) on the weekends. i definitely recommend it, and i would stay there again. it's also very nice that the apartment is dog-friendly, and there is a dog park right down the street. my pooch got a ton of exercise while i stayed there.

409582,4659324,2013-05-19,4846976,Deborah,"we loved the apartment. kelly was very informative about the property and very attentive to our needs. the location, near the capital, is unbelievable. there are a lot of restaurants to walk to and there are a lot of people out and about the neighborhood. we'd love to come back and rent the unit and visit the museums, memorials, and monuments."
409582,4915735,2013-06-02,4723867,Stephanie,"we enjoyed our stay in this 1 br apt in eastern market.  my fiance and i visited dc for a conference and site-seeing.  the location was great, particularly being right across the street from the eastern market metro station and a bike station, a short walk to eastern market (a must do on the weekends), and a wide variety of quality restaurants.  the capitol and national mall are just a bike ride away if biking is your thing (we personally loved biking and using the bikeshare system.  we walked to the capitol area a couple of times and walking was doable if you don't mind walking.)  apartment itself had everything we needed and comfortable bed.  having a washer and dryer is nice to have (a little small, but got the job done).  hosts are helpful, prompt to answer emails and texts, friendly, and attentive to details.  the bike pass and metro passes were a nice added bonus.  be aware that you may hear the family with 3 kids upstairs in the mornings if you plan to sleep in late (we woke early most mornings anyways, so not a problem for us.)   we would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone visiting dc who is looking for a great deal in a great location. "
409582,4991395,2013-06-06,4664603,Ursula,"we really loved our stay in dc with kelly and his family.  we had all of our basics met and any questions we had were promptly answered.  the location of the apartment was amazing with restaurants, stores, and the metro entrance just seconds of walking away.  kelly provided us with a great notebook of material on local foods, using the metro, the bikeshare, and more.  check in and out was super easy.  if we make it back to dc, we would definitely choose to stay here again."
409582,5077455,2013-06-11,5313517,Sandy,"we truly enjoyed our visit here. we felt safe, the host was very helpful and provided tips, bus and bike passes, and answered any questions for us. we felt connected to the city but yet the area was quiet and convenient. thank you!"
409582,5139945,2013-06-15,4764973,Bonnie,"if you are looking for a convenient, clean, friendly place to stay in the dc area, this is it! we totally enjoyed the friendliness and helpfulness of kelly and jack. the place is about a 2 minute walk to eastern market metro. the apartment itself is very comfortable, with all kinds of brochures available to browse. while we brought our own drinks and food, we appreciated that the kitchen was equipped with staples. the neighborhood was beautiful, and we felt safe at all times. there were many restaurants about a block away that we enjoyed. we would definitely stay there again if we were in the dc area. thanks guys!"
409582,5188998,2013-06-17,5392846,Louise,"my friends and i stayed at kelly's eastern market apartment for two nights, and enjoyed every aspect of the accommodations.  the hosts were both hospitable, and easy to work with!  from sending us metro passes ahead of time, to checking in on us once we arrived, they were sure that we were taken care of for the entirety of our stay.  

one of the best amenities of this apartment is the location!  we flew into reagan airport, and easily took the metro to the eastern market stop which is just steps from the front door of this apartment.  on the weekend of our trip there was a large farmers market/bazaar a few blocks away, and we enjoyed a walk to the national mall.  

the apartment is well equipped with everything you would need to make yourself feel at home!  we squeezed a total of 5 people into the unit, and we actually never felt cramped or on top of each other!  it was cozy!  

i would definitely recommend this listing for anyone who is looking for a place to stay in dc, and will contact kelly if i happen to be in dc again.

and kelly makes everything very easy providing the metro cards to get you started,  providing access to the capitol bike share program, netflix access on the tv, wi-fi, and a lot of other little touches. my family and i had a great time in dc and could not recommend this house more strongly."
409582,5597106,2013-07-08,5319899,Lisa,"this apartment was all it was described to be. a perfect location close to everything. across the street from the metro, close to shops, restaurants and the farmers market and two parks. walking or riding distance from the capital and mall. 

the apt was comfortable and had everything we needed. you will definitely hear noise from upstairs, as is mentioned, especially in the mornings. we found parking right in front and had our rv parked there the entire week. one thing i mentioned to the owners was the difficulty in opening and closing both the doors. they swell up in the heat. it was very difficult. 

if you want to be close to it all and not get in your car, this is a great place to stay. "
409582,5780452,2013-07-16,4369805,Laurence,"we stqyed at eastern market for 5 days that was our very first experience with airbnb, and we just loved it. the flat is as described, nothing is missing, you can really live here and feel home. all the necessary equipment is there, and it was a great plus to be able to do some washing with two young kids. there is a great espresso machine which we like very much as french travelers. the location is absolutely perfect, only 3minutes walking to the metro station and the area is provided with nice shops and market all to walking distance. for the children there are play grounds very closed to the flat and a water park, 10 minutes walk from the flat. my last comments will go to kelly and his family : they are delicious people, sweet and nice. kelly is a very attentive host always ready to bring attention to his guest. communication has been nice and efficient all the time, and kelly even sent us metro cards in advance as we spent one night in a hotel on our arrival. we will never forget that wonderful family and the way they welcomed us here in washington. thanks ! our kids did not want to leave and were crying when we left. 
nous avons séjourné chez kelly et jack pour notre première expérience airbnb. tout était parfait, l'appartement est parfaitement équipé, proche de toutes les commodités et à quelques minutes (3) du métro. les environs sont très agréables, avec parc pour les enfants tout près. dans l.apartement, il y a une machine à café ainsi q'un lave vaisselle , une machine à laver et un sèche linge, un gros plus avec des enfants. kelly et sa famille sont des hôtes extraordinaires, très facile pour communiquer, ils nous ont accueilli à bras ouverts, avec beaucoup de générosité et de gentillesse, cela resta pour nous qui sommes habitués à voyage une magnifique expérience !

409582,6018659,2013-07-27,4731134,Jessica,we had a wonderful time in the eastern market apartment. it was clean and had everything we needed and more.  the location was very close to the eastern market metro station as well as many restaurants.  we enjoyed being close enough to the capitol that we could still walk there but we took the metro to the smithsonian museums (only 4 stops away).  kelly was very prompt in responding to my questions about the apt.  we also very much appreciated his willingness to let us keep the parking pass and metro cards for a couple extra hours beyond our check-out time so we could check some last minute things off our  dc to-do list!
409582,6210414,2013-08-04,1298518,Bob And Connie,"we stayed for a week and had a great time. there was a delicious pie on the counter when we arrived. extremely clean and comfortable apartment, well equipped with everything you could possibly need. just steps from the subway which takes you to the places of interest. very close to many great restaurants; organic and safeway markets within easy walking distance. owners were attentive ensuring we were comfortable. it would be the place we'd stay if we retuned. fabulous week!"

409582,6680867,2013-08-21,5138366,John,"this is the first time that we have used airbnb. we decided to take a short family vacation to dc (and take a couple of college tours as well). i had spent my high school years in dc and almost never went east of the capital (because you just didn't go there in the seventies if you were from nw like i was). renting a furnished apartment for a week appealed to me because of the cost saving and the convenience of having a kitchen, so we decided to try it out. kelly was very communicative early on and gave us the lowdown. the apartment was in the basement, they had little kids and we would hear them in the mornings, etc. he provided ""smartrip"" cards for us and even mailed them to us before we left so we could use them to get into the city from the airport. 
the apartment was very nice, clean, well furnished (the keurig machine was a big hit), although a little tight for two adults and a seventeen-year-old. the location could not have been better, right across the street from the eastern market metro, surrounded by services, yet quiet at night. plenty of shopping and (the big surprise for me) several excellent restaurants (try montmartre and go to mr. henry's on monday night for half price burgers). yes, we could hear kelly, jack and the kids in their morning routine (about 6 am), but when you are in dc, you're going to get up and go out and sightsee anyway, so it wasn't a big deal. the one thing i wish were different was that the bed was a bit two small for two adults to stretch out, but we made do. i would say this place would be perfect for a young couple, but the price was right for us.."
409582,6931859,2013-08-31,6157940,Thevi,"we felt like home when we stayed at kelly's place.  it's perfect in every aspect.  the location, the eastern market and the convenient store, the metro station. kelly even provides parking permit for your car and metro smarttrip cards for you to use during stay. he's friendly and taking good care of the place, seeing from the details he laid out about his home.  only a kind loving person can   i'll recommend it to my friends for sure.  thanks kell!"
409582,7037430,2013-09-04,7576669,Rachelle,"our only complaint was that it was too hot to get to use the fireplace! the location was awesome and the apartment was cozy. it was the perfect place for a vacation with a 3 month old we were so glad we were able to do some laundry!! all the comforts of home!

kelly is great; terrific communication the whole way through. (he even helped me jump a dead car battery.)

the best thing is how close you are to the eastern market metro station - you can quite literally be riding the escalator down into the metro in under a minute.  this allowed us to easily visit many more museums and monuments than we would have been able to if we'd rented a hotel in the suburbs.  it also allowed us to come back in the middle of the day to rest up.

definitely will use this place again for future visits."
409582,7638702,2013-09-28,4851916,Sharon,"this location is everything that made our vacation wonderful.  it's right across from the metro station and in such an interesting neighborhood, lots of great places to eat and very nice people everywhere.  the little apartment had everything we needed.  i'll have to say the bed was a little softer than we liked but that was our preference.  that didn't keep me from sleeping though after full days of walking to see the sights.  we used the metro for transportation everywhere and no problems at all with that at all.  i would recommend this rental to anyone and in fact already have.  it's a good chance that we may come back so see the sights that we overlooked and definitely will stay here again.

416371,1324612,2012-05-21,2192008,Annette,"this was a perfect start to using airbnb on my trip to the us. joel was friendly and accommodating and very helpful in giving me advice about what to see in dc. don't bother wasting money in a hotel this was a perfect experience! felt totally at home, which is such a great thing when you travel. this is also the very best location for a stay in dc. close to everything and with bike hire across the road, it made the short bike ride to the white house and incredible museums and monuments so easy. i loved visiting this city - it took me by surprise and the accommodation made it even more memorable. "
416371,1347659,2012-05-25,2368619,Antonio,"joel and max are excelent hosts! the house is quite comfortable, and the location is fantastic! if you plan to visit dc, do not miss the opportunity to stay at joel's. i will surely stay at his place next time i visit dc! 
thank you joel."
416371,2107137,2012-08-27,2220277,Michael,"a very central and nice place with many features to appreciate. joel,  the host, has always been very helpful and a great company. strongly recomanded!"
416371,2503213,2012-10-04,2781496,Thijs,"i stayed in the lovely house of joel for about one month and really enjoyed my stay there. joel was an excellent host: friendly, helpful and great/interesting company. 
the location of his house is also amazing: nearby the always lively p st. nw (with restaurants, supermarket, ...) and a short walk to dupont circle, etc.
conclusion: highly recommended!!
thank you joel…
"
416371,2556583,2012-10-09,2980545,Chip,"joel is as gracious and welcoming as his home - and as my rating indicates, it was like being in one's own home, with one's favorite (you pick) brother, father, uncle...... 

the room was wonderful, the location very convenient and not too busy."
416371,2606346,2012-10-14,3628155,Annabella,"we had a brilliant time in washington staying at joel's place.  the room was bright and clean with a very comfortable (new) queen sized bed.  the house is very well located in town (20mins walk from the white house), lots of great restaurants and bars nearby and a public cycle hire docking which meant we zoomed round washington on our bikes.  joel was the perfect host, great recommendations for places to eat and visit and we absolutely loved mad max (the rather eccentric cat).  would highly recommend."
416371,2688456,2012-10-22,2043795,Ekaterina,"i had a fantastic time at joel's house: the moment i arrived i was immediately taken care of, and i felt like at home for the rest of my stay. the house is very clean, spacious and well-decorated. there is a nice collection of books, movies and a great music selection on joel's mac, so don't miss the opportunity to listen to it! joel was always great on advice and morning coffee, and i enjoyed talking to him a lot. oh, and max, he is the friendliest cat i've ever seen! i hope i will get to see them both some time again."
416371,2730419,2012-10-27,207365,Liz,"this is a very cute apartment in a great area.   joel was away for a conference but was still completely available to walk me through any and all questions i had about staying at his apartment.   i got to enjoy the whole place and bond with max the cat.   great location - very close to whole foods, pharmacy, lots of restaurants, studio theater.   joel is also a great host when i got to meet him and share stories about our work.   "
416371,2894859,2012-11-16,3584284,Elias,"this was my first experience using air b&b and it couldn't have been more positive. the apartment is very well located, in a lively neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, bars, and even a supermarket. it is walking distance from almost everything in dc (including world bank and idb). the room is spacious, with a good  and comfortable bed. moreover, it has a small desk if you need to work. heating was generous as well. joel is very friendly, helpful, and totally flexible with everything. he also speaks very good spanish (in case you have problems with english!). definitely, he makes you feel home. 
totally recommended, no doubt.
"
416371,2935379,2012-11-21,2748856,Michelle,"joel is a fascinating person; he is a physician and an international computer visionary.  joel was the perfect host.  he was extremely hospitable, helpful with orienting us to the city and to restaurants, and a really nice guy.  we might return to dc just to replicate our time there!"
416371,3079055,2012-12-12,1929470,Kip,"the location of joel's place couldn't have been better for my needs. one and a half blocks in one direction to my meetings and one block in the other direction to whole foods and starbucks. 

only negative was when max, the cat, decided he wanted me to wake up at 5am to play with him. i'm not sure what he was doing, but he made a ruccus outside my door. at both 5am and again at about 5:30am. other than that, it was a great stay. "
416371,3391451,2013-01-22,980947,Fabiola,"joel's place is great! 
we stayed at joel's house over the inauguration weekend and couldn't be a better location, close to the metro, buses, wholefoods market and is a walking distance (30min) to the mall even less (20 min) to the white house.
the house is spacious and well decorated. the bedroom is nice and clean, bed is comfortable. bathroom is clean and shower is really nice.
joel was helpful and friendly.  
if you are looking for a room in dc this is the one!"
416371,3557476,2013-02-16,1563664,Tyler,"place was great, joel is a classy guy. he dropped a tremendous line when i showed up that set the whole tone ""treat the fridge like you were at your friend's house, you'd have a beer but you wouldn't drink them all.""  great clean place, very comfortable, would stay again"
416371,3822775,2013-03-18,307873,Linda,"i stayed at joel's place for 8 nights while travelling for work. the location is excellent whether you're there for work or for vacation, with great shops and restaurants just a couple blocks away. i loved max, the very friendly resident cat. joel was pretty cool too.

416371,3891163,2013-03-25,137003,Nik,"my stay at joel's was great! the room was clean and ready for me when i arrived. joel communicated prior to my arrival with all the necessary information to make my stay easy. max (the cat) even met me at the door and welcomed me in!

the location is as good as it gets in dc! i walked everywhere, including to my convention hotel in vernon square. the neighborhood has lots of small new restaurants and is in close proximity to public transport. the airport shuttle had no problem picking me up at 6am sunday!

joel is a great host, and, as so often happens in airbnb stays, he and i even had quite a bit in common. that's what i love about staying in homes instead of hotels."
416371,3934849,2013-03-28,5628274,Pamela,"joel has had many intriguing careers to discuss and was responsive, conscientious and generous especially with his food offerings.  and, he helped with city guidance even after departure!"

would recommend anyone to stay at joel's and to enjoy the local amenities as there are plenty of restaurants within 10 minutes walk either on 14th or 17th street.
"
416371,4417771,2013-05-04,5153547,Kylie,"i cannot say enough good things about joel's place. the bedroom is large and comfortable, with lots of natural light. the kitchen, which i used extensively, is great. i stayed for three weeks and by the end of my stay the rowhouse felt like home. (i was sad to leave!)

the area is wonderful - literally around the corner from wholefoods, cvs and starbucks, so couldn't be more convenient. a 10 minute walk to dupont station along some of the most beautiful streets in dc. the area is very safe - i felt very comfortable walking home alone at night.

joel is the perfect host. easy to communicate with via email before my stay, and very accommodating.  he is a very knowledgeable, interesting person - i enjoyed our chats.

and max the cat was an adorable, incredibly playful friend throughout my stay. 

i would most definitely recommend joel's place for your stay in dc."
416371,4500342,2013-05-08,5424294,Gary,"joel has a great place in a great location.  he was very a responsive and gracious host to us.  it was a short stay (2 nights), but getting sorted with the in/out was painless, and really enjoyed chatting with him and hearing about all the changes in the neighborhood.  would definitely go back there again."
416371,4789433,2013-05-26,6027013,Corinne,"i stayed two weeks in may 2013 at joel's home ans it was just like at home. joel is a considerate host. his home is very well located with restaurants and super market at the corner, 10 minutes walk from dupont circle.... i plan to stay again at joel's home for two other weeks in september!"

my friend and i stayed at his place only for one day, but we are very impressed by his charming, friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable way. we really enjoyed getting to know him and talking with him. because our english is not very good, he tried to talk with us extra slowly and clearly! 

max the cat is so cute and adorable, i can't stop playing with him!! 

the apartment was comfortable and very convenient to all the major dc attractions. i highly recommend staying here and i would definitely stay again! "

unfortunately, i didn't get to meet joel because he was abroad. however, he checked in several times during my stay to make sure everything was good. "
416371,7936024,2013-10-08,1378240,Lennox,joel is the perfect host.  check in was a breeze.  the room was just as described.  the neighborhood is one of the prettiest in dc.  there were a number of shops and restaurants nearby and the metro at dupont circle was five blocks.

427825,4001759,2013-04-02,5047914,John,"the apartment was exactly as advertised. it's a basement apartment in the bloomindale neighborhood of d.c. close to the shaw metro and bus lines. tolu was very responsive to any questions that i had. 

i would definitely recommend staying here! "
427825,4601170,2013-05-14,1004860,Toby,"i had a great stay @ tolu's place.  

the apartment is small but comfortable and is as advertised.  it was great for me solo and would work fine for two people staying in the two separate bedrooms.  everything was clean and worked.  

the neighborhood is quiet and family oriented and near howard university's campus.  there are some bars and restaurants nearby (i enjoyed the public house) but it's not in a loud or wild area of town.  you'll want to call a taxi if you're looking for nightlife (taxi's are quite affordable in dc).

there is a small store on the corner which will provide necessities but for longer stays you'll need to visit a grocery store.  the in-unit laundry was very helpful for me.   

thanks, tolu!

437005,1212994,2012-05-01,493465,Mark & Elizabeth,great stay with greta. she was a delight to visit and a wealth of information and insight. very handy for public and private transport.
437005,1322541,2012-05-21,773879,Brian,"greta is both an amazing person and incredible host.  before i even committed to the arrangement, she informed me that i may want to consider that the last three days of my stay were going to be in an area that was about 40 miles away.  i'm on my motorcycle, and as it turns out, a tropical storm has come to the coast.  i would have been very wet each day.  during my stay, i was so comfortable that i barely saw dc.  she's done so much for the neighborhood as well, it's just so clear that anyone who gets to cross paths with her (much less have a stay) is a very lucky soul!"
437005,1417057,2012-06-04,1286107,Alex," greta is a gracious and incredibly thoughtful host. she let me know of possible weather issues coming into dc and made sure that her home was a comfortable and open place to stay. the location is a short stroll from the metro and a quick ride away from dc's major sites, while still managing to be in a very peaceful and relaxing neighborhood. great choice. "
437005,1482861,2012-06-14,2434646,Vanessa,"greta was a welcoming, lovely host and her home is absolutely amazing! we felt like we were in a 5 star boutique hotel with such gorgeous decor and a very spacious comfortable room.  anacostia is a gorgeous historic area of town that also undergoing regeration... give this neighbourhood another 5 years and it'll be the new georgetown...but better! we had a hire care so it was easy for us to venure away from inner dc to find somewhere different to stay and we also didn't have to work out public transport or walk around late at night with a map to find home.... so anacostia was an easy choice for us.
greta was so welcoming and friendly and also gave us tips and suggestions of places to see in the area - the fredrick douglas house is facinating... a must if staying in anacostia.  thanks for the tip greta, and thank you for offerring your gorgeous home on bnb."
437005,1499827,2012-06-17,2522665,Am, greta  was amazing! she goes far beyond the call of duty in order to be a great hostess. she was great about communication before and during our visit. she even came and picked us up from our bus stop. she  was informative and friendly the entire time. the bedroom is beautiful  and  spacious  and contains one of the best beds that we have ever slept  in. her house is located close to the metro stop and to bikes that you can rent to go anywhere in dc. though the subway area appeared a little scary the first night that we were there. the neighbors in the neighborhood proved to be very kind to us and safe. if you want a friendly welcoming house this one is it.greta has created a beautiful  home and helps you enjoy washington dc. we would definately stay here again. 
437005,1742941,2012-07-18,1686131,Ashley,"staying with greta was great! she was kind enough to pick me up from the station not only on the day i arrived, but also after a long day at work. it was an easy walk to the metro station though, i was just feeling lazy. the bed was super comfortable, the towels very soft, and the room had a large tv. i would definitively highly recommend greta's home to anyone who needs a place to stay in dc!"
437005,1831601,2012-07-29,2278720,Alice,"i enjoyed my stay with greta and would certainly book with her again.  she is very personable, gracious and helpful--she emailed me the details of how to best travel from dulles airport to her place and she offered to make some food for me when my flight was delayed. her home is a beautiful historic house filled with interesting art. it's clean, has a great bed in a good sized bedroom, and is on a quiet street. it is a 10 minute walk or less to the metro station and is only 3 metro stops to the mall with its museums and monuments.

437005,2117704,2012-08-27,188241,Alan,"greta was a very warm and gracious host and she has a lovely house. i would have liked to get to know her a little more, but we did not run into each other much. 
the neighborhood is a bit quiet after 9 pm or so, and one store owner who saw me walking down the street said i should be careful about walking alone in the area. but i did not have any problems. 
everything turned out exactly as greta had said. she gave me precise instructions on how to get from baltimore international airport to her house. she also gave me lots of useful tips on how to find things i was looking for. it was truly a pleasure to deal with greta, and i hope to cross paths with her again.

437005,2364758,2012-09-21,3483408,Dawn,"greta was beyond the hostess with the mostess!  she was so thoughtful and offered to drive me to a grocery store the first night i arrived.  during our conversations, i told her that my family would eventually be relocating to dc and i am checking out different neighborhoods within the city.  she so kindly took me on the best tour of all the areas and neighborhoods of the city - something that i could never have be able to do on my own or even with a realtor.  she told me all about each neighborhood and the history and what is is like today.  it was an absolute amazing tour and i was so appreciative!
greta is also a very interesting person with a kind heart and you can tell right away that she cares about her community and loves the people in her neighborhood.
her house is just simply amazing - not only is it a gorgeous older home that you instantly feel comfortable in, it is incredibly clean!  i have stayed in 5 star luxruy hotels that were not as clean and spotless as greta's home!
i look forward to another stay with greta soon!"

453159,1984750,2012-08-14,2957469,Erin,"crystals place was perfect for our needs-close to transporation, clean, actually really cute place, and she supplied all the amenities that one would need. crystal also left a wealth of information that we would need during our stay. it made for a great trip. the grocery store a block away was easy to get to, and had everything we needed.

we will certainly recommend to anyone!"

"
453159,3193341,2012-12-31,3047324,Kelly,"we were welcomed into this darling apartment by a lighted christmas tree and goodies in the refrigerator. that type of hospitality and attention to detail never let up the entire month of our stay. crystal and jon checked in periodically to see if we had what we needed and offered suggestions of must-see places and holiday-related activities around town, including a locals favorite for visiting santa, the best espresso nearby and favorite restaurants. they also provided a dc guide book, maps and reloadable fare cards for the metro. we felt more like house guests than ‘tenants,’ (yet they and their kids were respectful of our privacy).   

as well, crystal was candid before we made our reservation that there may be some construction noise during the start of our stay. once we were there, she worked to coordinate our schedules with the contractor’s to arrange noisy work for when we were away. 

the apartment itself was very clean and we had everything we needed in terms of bedding, towels and cookware. cell reception was iffy for my husband (sprint) but mine was fine (verizon) and we used the landline a fair amount. wireless internet access was great.

the apartment is less than 5 minutes walking distance to a grocery store and the metro. and the eastern market area – about a 15 minute walk – was a favorite destination, with lots or restaurants, an organic market, farmers market and locally-owned shops. a great gym is 20 minutes walking distance.

we would recommend this apartment to anyone! 
"
453159,3285119,2013-01-06,2251260,Dave,"crystal was so accomodating and she left us all sorts of goodies for our arrival. the house was extremely comfortable and we loved the location. close to the metro, shops etc...

hot water was in short supply and this proved tp a small issue for four guests. but upon contacting her, she dealt with the issue promptly.

would definitely return!"
453159,3405207,2013-01-24,260151,Ira,"crystal's apartment was incredible. it was immaculate and very comfortable for our party of three. everything worked (website hidden by airbnb) problems whatsoever. crystal provided lots of useful tourist info, including restaurant recommendations. the location is superb, a short 5 minute walk to the metro station. capitol hill offers a wide variety of eateries, all within walking distance of the apartment. two supermarkets are located within a five minute walk.  i would highly recommend this apartment to anyone traveling to washington dc.

453159,3781435,2013-03-14,4965788,Kevin,"wow!  crystal's place had everything you could want and then some.  the place was immaculate, well decorated, everything detail was covered in her ""guest guide"" along with lots of information on the area.   i can't say enough about how perfect the entire experience was.  why would anyone go to a hotel?  

the eastern market was fabulous and fun.  the capitol bike share program is very easy to use and well worth checking out.  they have stations everywhere you turn.  the metro is the easiest to use in the world and just 1.5 blocks away.  just too much to mention.

453159,3853194,2013-03-21,4906274,Amy,"we had the best time in this beautiful home.  first, it is absolutely lovely.  the home is clean, beautiful, and very comfortable.  beds are great and it has all the amenities of home.  also, it is in a wonderful location.  it is about a 3 minute walk to the metro station, where you can catch the metro rail or bus.  from there, you can go anywhere.  there are many places to eat within walking distance and there is a grocery store right around the corner.  so we were able to pick up a few groceries for breakfast and snacks throughout the day.  the neighborhood is quiet and it gets you away from much of the ""tourist feel"" that we spent all day in.  the host, crystal, was so nice.  she offered some very helpful suggestions that really helped.  her neighbor even came over to check on us when we arrived.  
we traveled with 3 children, ages 11, 8 and 3.  this place is ideal for a couple, a family, or just about anyone.  we cannot say enough great things about this home and our experience,  i highly recommend this beautiful home to anyone traveling to washington dc.  "
453159,3936085,2013-03-29,4665742,Sarah,"we had a great week in dc with this home as our base!  i especially appreciated the small extras: the home was equipped with some drinks, snacks and even some breakfast options (coffee!!!) for those who arrive and don't have a chance to hit the store!  crystal was very responsive to questions!  it is extremely easy to access the city from this location!! thanks for sharing your home crystal!"
453159,4104680,2013-04-10,1323901,Mike And Kelly,"this is an excellent property!  the apartment is clean, roomy and well appointed.  the location is perfect.  you are a little off the beaten path and away from the crowds, but close to everything you need like stores and places to eat.  the bus and metro are an easy walk (my 90 year old father had no problem) and you are a couple to a few stops away on the metro to everything you want to see and experience.  crystal and jon were very warm and helpful hosts.  we had a perfect stay.  "
453159,4231628,2013-04-21,2037329,David," yes,yes! we loved the quaint apartment,just 1.5 miles from the capitol.nice quiet neighborhood near the potomac metro station.
 chrystal has an amazing gift of hospitality! there were a few goodies,some eggs,along with a sampling of yogurt,fruit juice,even a couple of beers we found.her husband john, is a kind and gentle man too.we used the maps,magazines,guidebooks with,her own recommendations really spot on!
 the bikes we rented from union station are the way to go,got as far as the jefferson memorial,even the nice mounted police officer said it's ok to ride on the sidewalks except downtown!
 an oasis of quietude and tranquilty in the nation's capitol."
453159,4321160,2013-04-28,57476,Jane & Earl,the apartment is fantastic and very well supplied. crystal is a pleasure. we can't recommend this place enough!
453159,4782568,2013-05-26,667640,Jim And Betty,"crystal and jon's apartment served our needs extremely well.  we were four adults and really appreciated the two full bathrooms and the beds were so comfortable that betty now isists that we need a new queen matress at home.  we stayed for 28 days and did most of our own cooking made much easier by the well equipped kitchen and complete appliances.  all of this was made even better by the harris teeter complete supermarket just one block from the house that has everything from organic food, beer, bakery, buffet bar for carry out meals and redbox dvd movie rentals.  
     public transportation  (busses and subway) along with bikeshare are all in the harris teeter area.  all in all, it was the most efficient and convenient big city location we have ever experienced.
     crystal and jon were very warm and accommodating hosts who were always concerned about how we were doing.  however, things went along so smoothly that we rarely had to contact them and when we did we had a timely response.  crystal has assembled a notebook with various headings that provide information about all things dc related and will answer just about any questions you may have.  there is some construction in immediate area and some noise associated with it, but only  during middle of  the day; nights are very quiet.
     when we visit dc in the future we hope to stay again with crystal and john.   jim and betty "
453159,7333145,2013-09-16,3010071,Jill,"great location a block from potomac ( orange/blue lines) metro.  wonderful hostess and lovely clean apartment. pictures are pretty representative, but nicer in person.      comfortable, private and quiet home away from home.  nicely equipped kitchen. lots of storage and closet space in bedrooms and hall closets.small, but adequate well thought out bathrooms ( dc homes of this era are not known for large bathrooms). glad there were too. ladies especially will appreciate the good lighting. comfortable beds and comfy bath towels and bed linens. crystal and family could not have been nicer. she's a fountain of knowledge about the area and a real dc booster. be sure to ask her about the history of her house and the apartment.
starter packages of goodies in the kitchen if you arrive after the good local supermarket one block away is closed. half & half  and bottled water in the refrigerator.  many restaurants and dare i mention starbuck's within a few blocks walking distance. try the vietnamese one on pennsylvania ave or acqua al 2 in eastern market area. variety of good ethnic cuisines in barracks row, also easy walking.  15- 20 minute pleasant walk to capitol or 5 min. on metro.  i  needed a place that was close to my daughter and infant grandson that was within walking distance for couple weeks.  this was perfect.  my grandson loved splashing around in the bathtub.much better than staying in hotel. walking around the (well -lit at night) neighborhood i got to know the neighbors.  very friendly. lots of pride and care.  if you want a taste of city living you won't be disappointed! "
453159,9049671,2013-12-03,7081338,Claudine,"we were resident in this fantastic apartment for october and november 2013, and as a family of four (including a newborn baby) we found it to be a perfect 'home from home'. it is well equipped (good quality linens, appliances, kitchen goods, lots of tupperware, shopping bags, umbrellas). the apartment is also stylish, clean, spacious and it is in a superb location. the description provided by crystal is accurate and she is a wonderful host, careful not to intrude but always available and helpful. crystal and her family were extremely welcoming and kind (including providing toys and halloween outfits for our girls). they were super efficient and open (for example flagging up possible short term internet problems and some disruption due to refurbishment work), and they were communicative any time we needed any advice or when any apartment maintenance issues arose (none of which were serious and all of which were tackled instantly). the apartment is in a basement and there are about five steps down to the front door from the yard. it was comfortable both in scorching heat and in the cold. we absolutely loved the neighbourhood (one of the cleanest and friendliest we, londoners, have stayed in). we never felt unsafe. walking to the mall is easy, as it is to the countless parks and playgrounds on the hill. we also made heavy use of the metro (although it is not always stroller-friendly as elevators break down etc) and the local zip cars (there are plenty of car hire options). the apartment is in easy reach of driving routes to sights such as old town alexandria and mount vernon. food shopping is easy at the two supermarkets close by or at eastern market, about a 15 minute walk away. there are also lots of fun and nice restaurants and cafés to walk to to the west and north of the apartment. we would have no hesitation in staying again or in recommending this apartment to anyone else visiting this super city."
453159,9161344,2013-12-10,7763601,Karen,"crystal was in continuous contact with us before and during our stay.  her place was clean, clean, clean which is of upmost importance to us. the apt. was spacious, wonderfully decorated with top notch comfort in bedding, linens and towels. we will not hesitate to stay again. with our daughter living a few blocks away, we all have another home in dc now.

453159,9421017,2013-12-28,4645933,Silvia,"we had a lovely stay in this apartment! modern and furnished with taste we found everything we need (including some bio products in the fridge and a nice welcoming gift :)). crystal and her husband gave us a warm and kind welcome and made clear we could reach them anytime we needed help or had doubts. very comfortable beds and the flat is situated very conveniently close to the subway. big supermarket 5 minutes walk from the house. what else to say? well, if i'm back to dc i'd stay there again. ah, don't miss the cute squirrels in the street :)."
458046,1625798,2012-07-03,1909452,Brian,"matt and jean were perfect hosts.  this was our first time using airbnb and they made us a believer.  their place was immaculately kept, the most beautifully decorated, very spacious, and a great location just a block from the capital building.  with our five children, my wife and i felt extremely comfortable in their guest house.  the kids felt at home and it was big enough that we didn't feel like we were right on top of each other like in hotel rooms.   matt and jean were extremely gracious and helpful.  they even provided us with some light breakfast food to get us started.  i was not expecting that and it was such a thoughtful gesture.  they were the best.  i really didn't want to leave the place and want to hire them to professionally decorate my own home.  i really cannot say enough about the place and the hosts.  they made our weekend get-away one of the best we've had in a long time.  we definitely would use them again should we go back to the dc area."
458046,1724823,2012-07-16,2834906,Stephane,"this house is awesome. three floors, four queen/king beds, full kitchen, lovely terrace and great location (just a short walk from the capitol). the street is full of similar lovely houses, nice porch (love the red door), full of flowers in front and in the back yard. large garage is much appreciated. everything was in perfect condition, and best of all, matt and jean were wonderful hosts.  their enthusiasm was very communicative and we felt that they really care about our experience.

my wife and i and our three children really appreciated our stay in dc.  we already went on many vacations using rentals (paris, barcelona, nyc ...); this house was the best we ever stayed in.  even more important, matt and jean were the most welcoming and charming host we ever met."

458046,1948483,2012-08-11,2692703,Jerry,"we arrived early in dc. and jean and matt  were very generous and allowed us to leave our luggage with them...freeing us to do things in the afternoon. they were charming and their place was wonderful. we found everything first class,from the furnishings to the bedsheets. there was even a keurig coffee machine in the kitchen. in addition, much to our surprise, they had left us everything we would need for breakfast for  the week we were there.the location of their place is unbeatable as it was one block from the metro and two blocks from the capitol and four blocks from the mall. we can't recommend them high enough as everything was so first class."
458046,2028829,2012-08-19,2797637,Susana,"jean and matt are excellent hosts! we stayed at their ""capitol hill guest house 3br+loft"" in mid-august 2012. this house is amazing. it has been renovated and furnished with a careful attention to details and quality which also extends to bedding, towels, complete kitchen supplies and equipment, and other extras. jean and matt had stocked the kitchen with plenty of breakfast supplies.
everything was extremely clean and comfortable. the garage was easy to use. the house really is very close to the metro station and the capitol, but nevertheless on a quiet street with several restaurants close by. it was a wonderful place to return to after long days of sightseeing.
all the positive statements in previous reviews are accurate, as is the official description posted on the airbnb page. everything we found exceeded our expectations. "
458046,2123270,2012-08-28,684142,Erica,"the house is absolutely beautiful and the extra touches (extra comfy bed, fluffy towels and sheets, keurig coffee machine, grill, etc.) makes staying here truly enjoyable. the house is very close to transportation, yet quiet. i would highly recommend this place to anyone considering visiting dc and i would not stay anywhere else but here on my next trip.

truly a gem!"
458046,2159318,2012-09-01,819900,Wendy,"the argersinger's capitol hill guest house was a perfect place for our stay with kids in dc. it is very elegant and spacious, allowing everyone in our party a place to be together as well as space to read or have quiet time. it is extremely convenient to visit the capitol, the library of congress and the rest of the museums are accessible using the south capitol metro stop, which is a block away. the argersingers were so kind to provide an assortment of delicious, fresh breakfast goodies--which was really helpful given that we flew in very late from the west coast, and the kids were starved! they were excellent hosts, and their house comes highly recommended!"

matt and jean were very accommodating, friendly, and helpful in organizing.  they left snacks for us upon our arrival and left plenty of extras around the house that made it more special to stay here.  everything was easy and well thought out.

458046,3118068,2012-12-19,2791120,Sue,"matt and jean are the best hosts we could ever have imagined.  this was our first experience with airbnb and we are now converts and will be singing the praises of airbnb and matt and jean in particular.  their home in washington was perfect in terms of location (2 blocks from the capitol building and the mall), space and decor, cleanliness and comfort.  we particularly loved the wonderful beds and linen, and the home made ginger bread.  we only wish we could have stayed a week to fully appreciate the house and its convenience and pampering.  it was ideal for our family of 6 including 4 older teenagers.

458046,3400086,2013-01-23,4067533,Greg,"we stayed here for the presidential inauguration with another family - 4 adults and 4 kids aged 8-14. it was a fantastic experience and jean and matt were gracious hosts. the fridge was stocked just like home - organic and healthy food - and they even picked up one family at the train station and brought them to the house. the location is steps from restaurants, the metro, and the us capitol. 

when we return to dc we will definitely stay here again.

458046,3516017,2013-02-11,578668,Jerry,"matt and jean blew away my expectations of airbnb hosting. 

i ran a meeting over three days in their place, and i can say without any doubt that our event was made much better by their sophisticated yet unobtrusive hospitality. they not only recommended superb local sources for meals, they also received the food and set a beautiful table for us. that attitude, of making our time in their place better than expected, was present from initial contact here through our last goodbyes. 

their townhouse is beautifully decorated and stocked with enough plates, flatware, etc, that we were always comfortable. they adapted the furniture in the house so we could eat together at one table and work together in a lofted meeting space -- all in the shadow of the nation's capitol. 

being in a house instead of a meeting venue (what i thought we'd be in) was key to the success of my meeting. our hosts' warmth and expertise made it that much better. 

my assistant sent me a recommendation for matt and jean, which i've folded into my comments. they have my heartfelt thanks and recommendation. stay here!"
458046,3582733,2013-02-19,1199718,L.,"we were a group of friends on a trip to see the art museums in washington. matt & jean's place couldn't have been more perfect for us. we walked to the national gallery in 15 minutes. we walked in the other direction to the eastern market and restaurants. everything about their house was thoughtful and convenient - from the key code door entry (making sharing keys a non-issue), to the breakfast foods supplied for us in the kitchen to the 2.5 bathrooms with soaps, shampoos and other amenities, to the extremely comfortable beds and fine linens. everyone in our group reported sleeping well. one night we ordered in pizza and sat together at the large dining room table. one night we all watched  the season finale of downton abbey in the third floor sitting area. we just had a blast. when we had a question about the dvd player, jean called us back right away and even offered to come help us set it up. jean and matt were very friendly, excellent hosts. staying here made our trip to washington special. we felt like we had our own private boutique hotel.

jean and matt are the perfect hosts, and we were treated to a lovely hamper of food, yoghurts, orange juice and other goodies in the fridge and a bottle of prosecco when we arrived after a long flight from scotland. we were so thrilled that they came to the screening of my brother's short film at the film festival too. they are really friendly and such lovely people. they also reply really quickly to any questions you have before and during your stay and go above and beyond every time.

everything in the house is brilliant - the kitchen is fully stocked with every kind of utensil, crockery, coffee machine you could ever want and there's even a waffle maker! the beds are incredibly comfy and we felt at home as soon as we arrived.

the house is in a great location near all the main sights, and the capitol south subway station is round the corner. 

we have recommended this lovely house to all of our friends & family and to the film festival organisers, and would love to stay here again! "

458046,4492754,2013-05-08,1240756,Kristin,"what a large, lovely home only two minutes from capitol hill! the place easily accommodated six adults and two babies. we had big family meals in the well-equipped kitchen and lounged in the garden out back. the location makes it very convenient to enjoy major washington attractions. and it's just a short walk to eastern market to pick up fresh ingredients and delicious food. we would definitely stay here again if we're ever back."

458046,5428242,2013-06-30,5293242,Linda,we spent our yearly family vacation and with seven of us (all adults) there was plenty of room.  the house is close to everything and we all enjoyed long walks around the capitol and the mall with all its museums.  we were welcomed with everything we needed for breakfast as well as chocolate and wine for relaxing.  we had two cars so the garage was great as well as the parking permit for the second one.  can't think of anything that would have made us feel any more welcome.
458046,5896645,2013-07-21,3922659,Patrick,"matt and jean are responsive to any requests. they left us two messages make sure our stay was comfortable, and asking if we could use anything. the house is fully stocked for a family living there for a week or a month. fantastic property, in a wonderful neighborhood, with warm and attentive hosts. we'd stay there in a heartbeat. we actually live in the area and were having our house renovated. no that we know about matt and jenn's place, we'll recommend it to friends and family that come to town."

i recommend the place!"

519159,3819868,2013-03-18,5041241,Cindy,"if you're heading to dc and have the good fortune to, stay in this house! you will be so incredibly glad you did.

our time in dc was totally enhanced by our accommodations; staying at vanessa's home was pure, unadulterated bliss. the house itself is a revelation -- clean, modern, yet quite cozy and aesthetically super nice with really interesting architecture, all kinds of amenities, top notch appliances, and a tremendously admirable zero waste lifestyle effort. it also has this fantastic natural light pouring through the windows.

vanessa is unbelievably kind, lovely, gracious, and courteous -- she warmly welcomed us into her home and made sure that we were comfortable. she even took the time to meet beforehand to give a tour of the house and answer questions.

we felt completely at home during our stay. i hosted a bridal shower tea at the house and vanessa took great pains to make sure i knew how to operate the appliances and where to find anything we might need -- whether it be linen napkins or table settings. 

the neighborhood is terrific -- peaceful but with lots of excitement and fun things to do around the corner (shows, restaurants, bars) a rad cafe up the block, the supermarket a quick walk away. i did a lot of walking and that was quite nice, although the subway was just a few blocks away. the neighborhood is pretty central and allowed for quick access to various parts of the city.

communicating with vanessa was also a breeze -- she was super accessible before, during, and even after our stay. always available to answer a question and responded quickly to any inquiries we had during the weekend. she never made us feel like a bother. we left behind some items in the house and she was super kind to keep them safe and offered to mail them.

our experience staying in vanessa's house was truly excellent. it was just wonderful and kind of hard to leave. i highly recommend staying here!
"
519159,4839199,2013-05-28,3685985,Eden,"this house is beyond what the listing displays. the house is gorgeous, and really inspirational with its eco-friendly/forward-thinking technology, funky art and furniture, and lush gardening around the house. the location is perfect, embedded in a neighborhood with lots of fun little coffee shops, restaurants, and boutiques--and all the fun dc touristy stuff is just around the corner. we felt like dc locals during our stay :). 

vanessa is super friendly, warm, and hospitable. she gave me a (hidden by airbnb) tour of the place before i arrived, and was easy to get a hold of (even though she was abroad during our stay). people like vanessa, and places, like this one, are the reason why i love using airbnb."

great house and great location! very comfortable and eco-friendly. the only issue we ran into had to do with the thermostat, which was unfortunate considering the heat wave. i would still recommend this house in the future. "

519159,6117763,2013-07-30,5277611,Sarah,"this house is magnificent both inside and out. my whole family stayed here for a weekend, and everyone from grandpop to my one year-old niece was comfortable and happy. (my mom even referred to it as her ""dream home."")

i've never cooked in a kitchen that was so well designed, and as you can see from the lovely pictures, the dining space is a large and relaxing place to have a meal or just hang out. the gardens out front were also a real treat -- we even made a stir fry with the vegetables and herbs we picked!

in addition to being gorgeous and functional, the house is well stocked with games and toys that the kids loved. and we had a great time watching movies on the big screen with the house's ceiling-mounted projector. 

vanessa was a generous and very helpful host -- she communicated quickly and clearly, and answered all of my questions. she also has prepared a helpful guide to the house with detailed info about every appliance if you need it (we had no problems with the thermostat or anything else).

the whole experience was wonderful, and my family has already told me that they want to stay here again the next time that they visit dc."

(so much nicer and more spacious than a comparably-priced hotel!)  desiree was a gracious host who went out of her way to ensure that our visit was a smooth one.  we had a wonderful dc visit, and our stay at desiree's place added immensely to such a memorable trip."
525672,2150216,2012-08-31,2651275,Susan,"our stay at desiree's apartment was excellent.  her apartment was modern, clean and beautifully appointed, for our stay in washington. it was easy to either walk to the metro (1 block away) or walk to the capitol for sightseeing.  she was able to organise a slightly earlier check in so we could leave our bags after arriving by train which was very helpful.  we appreciated the extra little things like snacks and condiments so we were able to make our own meals easily - there is a supermarket within the same block close to the metro.  we would highly recommend staying at desiree's apartment and wished we could have stayed longer!"
525672,2239146,2012-09-09,45182,Tom,this beautifully appointed apartment was convenient to all i had to do in dc and welcomed me back at the end of each long day.  desiree was near-instantly available to answer any questions and in such a way i felt cared for but never intruded upon.  i felt instantly at home and left with regret i wasn't staying longer.
525672,2271268,2012-09-12,401003,Jeff,i stayed at desiree's apartment a few weeks ago and had a great time. the apartment is exactly as described and how it looks on the photos - nice modern decor and spotlessly clean. the part was also perfectly located - about a 15 mind walk to the capitol and about 5 mins away from a street which had an array of bars and restaurants - which saved going back into the main centre of washington in the evening. i would recommend this apartment to anyone who is looking for a modern place close to amenities and the subway.
525672,2303893,2012-09-17,3016724,Arvind,"it was a wonderful experience. the apartment was neat and clean and desiree made sure we had basic food items like milk, cereals and popcorn. the apartment is located very conveniently , close to 8th street which has some awesome eating joints and to 2 metro stops. we had a really good time. desiree had a map of the place and metro smart cards ready for our use. she was very much available for all our qs and met us at the time of check in. thank you desiree.
"
525672,2492628,2012-10-02,332159,Emily,"we were very excited to stay here, but were disappointed to arrive to an unlocked apartment with a non-functioning front door lock. we contacted the host desiree immediately, she was aware the lock was broken and had planned to address this a week later, after our stay was completed. we decided to make other arrangements as we did not feel safe in this part of the city in an unsecured apartment (the neighborhood noise level and volatile nature of the sounds, and police activity in the area did little to calm our concerns). the entry was dark with steep curved stairs to the front door, the barred screen door could be opened from the outside if the glass front door was opened (and the front door could just be pushed in from the outside as it couldn't be locked). we were unable to secure ourselves in the apartment, or secure our stuff in the apartment if we wanted to leave the apartment during our stay, so we felt we had no choice but to make other last-minute arrangements. also it took almost 2 hours for a cab to come back to pick us up, even with multiple calls. the bicycle cops in the area told us they usually travel in teams of 6 officers due to the safety concerns.  with or without the main issue of the broken lock,  i wouldn't recommend the apartment due to the safety issues. and also wanted to explain why we cancelled the stay after arriving and finding the place unacceptable."
525672,2551104,2012-10-08,3382892,Nikki-Rae,"this was our first experience with airbnb.  

desiree was an extraordinary hostess!  friendly, quick to respond, and hospitable (to say the least)!  desiree quickly responded to answer my questions.  she was more than happy to accommodate us despite our last minute request.  she was also flexible about the check-in time to accommodate our flight time.  

the property was gorgeous, well kept, and newly remodeled.  the kitchen was fully stocked with pots/pans/dishes/coffee maker and even had some food items.  desiree had a welcome box with popcorn, oatmeal, and some other items, which was a really nice touch.  we felt very comfortable staying here.  it was definitely a home away from home.

also, having the use of her smartrip metro cards was really nice and saved us a lot of money since the paper fare cards cost more per trip.  her house manual told us of cool things to do in the area, including restaurants, tourist attractions, etc.  it also had a metro map so we could plan our trip before leaving the house.  there was so much information in it, even if we didn't have our trip sort of planned out, the house manual alone could have kept us busy during our week-long stay.

the property is close to h street, which is a new up-and-coming place to hang out for locals.  you can take a short walk to eastern market (10 min away) or keep on walking and arrive at the capitol building (20+/- min away).  there's a lot of things to do in this area.  the metro is also conveniently located nearby.  

we would definitely stay here again.  in fact, we would have loved to stay longer.  thanks, desiree, for making our first airbnb experience a great one."
525672,2602966,2012-10-14,2026033,Simone,"the apartment was great, just like the pictures.  there were lots of special treats, condiments, teas etc. in the apartment which was a nice touch.  with special request around my check-in, desiree was very responsive and even took a special trip into dc to make sure i was able to move in.  "
525672,2735284,2012-10-28,2982859,Ken,"our experience with desire and staying at her apartment can be summed up in a simple word.
wow!!!

the place was as advertised in the pictures provided and desiree was a great hostess.  she secured a parking pass for us in advance since we drove in and provided some great options for dining out during our stay.  desiree was very easy to communicate with and very responsive to our questions while we were staying in town.  in addition the location can't be beat!  so close to 8th street and a block from the metro and shopping center to stock up for the stay.

we were very happy with all aspects of our stay and would definitely book this apartment again if we travel to d.c.  in addition, we have enthusiastically recommend this place to all our friends who are thinking of a dc vacation.  hands down, this beats staying in a hotel for comfort, convenience and cost.

525672,2797805,2012-11-04,3068327,Jose,"we had a great stay at penn on the hill! desiree was most welcoming, the apartment had a lot of extras and all in all it was very comfortable. bearing in mind that we even had to stay in a full day because of the sandy hurricane, one really starts to appreciate the well equipped kitchen and living room. it is very well located in the nice capitol hill neighborhood. the apartment is very near, 5min walking, to eastern market with all kind of nice shops, restaurants and little coffee places. they gave us a very nice and welcoming halloween experience, how wonderful for our kids. it's very near two metro stops, and desiree even provides for metro cards!  so really everything was taken care of, we were really at ease with our two little children and we thoroughly enjoyed all washington's got to offer. i'd recommend this place to anyone!"
525672,2837655,2012-11-08,3294224,Carmel,"my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our stay in dc. from the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome by desiree (she even helped us get our bags inside which was greatly appreciated). 

our time @ capitol hill was amazing & we loved coming home each night to our apartment. the apartment was more than we could have ever hoped for & leaving was very hard to do. our time @ capitol hill set a president that no other accommodation met. 

we would stay again & we regret having only had 3 nights there. desiree is a wonderful host & so very accommodating from the folder with all local information, things to do etc to letting us use the washing machine which was very welcome after travelling. the addition of snacks was also well received after arriving and being exhausted. 

10 stars if possible for desiree & her capitol hill accomm. 

a million thanks from jarrod and myself. "
525672,2900928,2012-11-17,3753565,Joan,"we absolutely loved this apartment! it was our first time to use airbnb and desiree set our standards real high!  the apartment is exactly as it appears in the pictures (clean, organized and fully equipped) and had everything we needed to make our stay convenient, comfortable and feel a little bit like home. the place is just a few blocks away from the metro so there was no difficulty getting around and exploring dc. 

it was very easy to get in touch with desiree and she was very helpful and answered all our questions.  she was also kind enough to lend us metrocards and leave a binder full of maps, notes and tips to help us newbie travelers get around.  

we would definitely be staying here again :)"

525672,3435330,2013-01-29,4222593,Patrick,"this was a great place to stay while in dc, so much better than a hotel! we were visiting my brother who about 2 blocks away and even had our 18 month old daughter with us. they just had their first child, so it was great to be walking distance and still have a place to ""retreat"" to for some privacy. we felt safe our entire visit and there are some wonderful restaurants down the way by the marine barracks. the metro station is nearby and you're a short job or taxi from the capital area. i highly recommend this place if you need to stay in the area."

we were pleased to have metro fare cards for our use and we used them well. being a 5 minute walk to the metro station was wonderful. 
we did our grocery shopping at the nearby harris teeter store and ate at la lomita, a local mexican restaurant that makes very tasty margaritas.
for people who travel without a car this was a great location and reasonably priced."

525672,5575156,2013-07-07,295481,Brian,"the apartment is well appointed and conveniently located close to the potomac (1.5 blocks away) and the eastern market (~4 blocks away) metro stations. as a basement flat, it stayed cool throughout the day which was quite a refreshing change after touring in dc's july heat and humidity. the hideaway bed was comfortable as hideaway beds go; the queen bed in the bedroom was comfortable as well. we didn't do any cooking but instead made use of the salad bar at the harris teeter grocery store which is only a block away. cab fare from reagan national to the apartment is very reasonable - $23 including tip. even though someone lives in the upstairs apartment, we never heard them. desiree has compiled a nice binder of different things to do in dc and has 4 metro smartcards for guests use (hint: using a smartcard saves $1 per trip on the metro system vs. using a paper ticket. this can really add up if you plan to use the subway/buses to get around). i would definitely stay here again."
525672,5944395,2013-07-23,5114495,Greg,i found this apartment to be an excellent place to stay. the weather was very hot in the week i was in washington and this apartment is pretty much a basement apartment and with excellent air conditioning. i was very comfortable and felt at home. it was close to the potomac subway and harris teeter store. i walked to the baseball game along the river bank. 
525672,6194721,2013-08-03,6844246,Nicole,"if you are going to dc for work or for vacation desiree's penn house on the hill is ideal. close to two metro stations and within reasonable walking distance to restaurants, capitol hill, and other sights, everything in dc is within your reach. head up to 8th street for your pick of all types of cuisines or around the corner to harris teeter grocery if you want to cook in the apartment. 

if you enjoy walking you can get to the capitol and the mall within 20-30 minutes. i walked up and back to the library of congress everyday without a problem. if you are not a walker, hop on the metro!

the apartment is great for singles, couples, or small families. while the weather was mild during our stay, being in the basement kept us cool. the bed was comfortable, the kitchen is well-stocked with cooking and dining implements. 

i would not hesitate to stay at desiree's place again. "

perfectly located on capital hill, 200m from orange and blue metro stop ´´potomac ave´´, is a very nice spot to explore the city by foot and public transportation.
to be positively considered the parking pass and the smartcard for the metro made available by desiree .

agree with the other commenter here about the neighborhood not feeling safe (although nothing bad happened). there was also construction going on but desiree asked us beforehand what time we start in the morning so we weren't bothered that much.

had a great time!

525672,8693669,2013-11-12,9290214,Jenilyn,"pros:
*10 minute uberx ride ($18) away from dca
*1.5 blocks to the nearest metro  
*1 block to harris teeter market 
*1 block from capital bikeshare
*2 metro stations from library of congress 
*full kitchen 
cons
-far from nw region where all the good restaurants and bars are ($16 uberx ride away)
-although nothing bad happened, the neighborhood just doesn't feel safe (a few drivers told us the neighborhood is ""a lot better now"" and that it used to be very bad
-walls are so thin we could hear every conversation and footstep happening above us during construction/painting (apartment is a remodeled basement of the building)
the experience
let me preface by saying that desiree is a nice person and that her apartment is clean and cosy. she came by when we arrived in the evening to introduce herself and before she left she asked us when we were getting started with our day so she can tell the construction workers. we told her we are getting an early start and it didn't exactly set in that there would be construction going on in same building above us since that is something that is normally disclosed to a tenant beforehand...the next day we got an early start and went on our congressional tour and saw a few sites. we returned to the apartment around 3pm to full-blown construction happening on the building. one person was priming the side of the building causing dust and soot to fall all over the place with a ladder that was in the way of the entrance. we had to yell to the guy to stop for a moment so we can get in the apartment. when we finally got in the apartment all we wanted to do was rest, but that definitely wasn't going to happen with all the noise happening inside and outside of the building. we let it pass as we didn't want it to ruin our trip so early on. when we left that same evening around 8pm i almost hit my head on the now erected scaffolding covering the entire front side of the building. wtf?! we let it pass. the next morning around 8am we woke up to the construction workers arriving. i couldn't let this pass. i sent desiree an email. she responded with a bs response saying ""they were supposed to be done 2 weeks ago and they were only painting."" not exactly a solution to the problem.. in the end, she finally offered to refund us for 1 day on our last day and somewhat owned up to her failure to tell us that there would be construction during our stay. being the patient people we are, we happily accepted and tried to enjoy the rest of our trip, outside of the apartment.  she shorted us $5 on the refund since we paid $120/ni. lol! our advice: ask her if she will be moving in or will be having any construction done before you book.

525672,8873182,2013-11-23,9807226,Isis,nice apartment that is fairly close to the capitol.  the place is clean and very updated.  it's easy to walk to the metro and to a local natural food store and drug store to grab breakfast items so you don't have to rush out in the morning to grab breakfast.  also some good restaurants nearby.  it's quiet at night which is nice for sleeping at night.

556729,3850203,2013-03-20,5436884,Daniel,"i will give robin the highest  ratings and comments!! i was met by her warm, kind, informative airbnb roomate-miguel-he showed me my lovely, spacious clean room, as well as the rest of the clean house. i was made to feel comfortable, and relaxed. i relaxed for a few hours upon my arrival, and the house, area was very quiet.i had plenty of clean towels, the bathroom was very clean like everything else there. across the street is a bus stop which is extremely convenient. the room is only about 2 1/2 miles from the white house so the location is an attractive plus as well. when i came back later that evening, i met/talked with robin. she is a very kind, warm, and personable woman. again, i was made to feel so relaxed and welcome. i slept like a baby that night and left at checkout time. in closing, i give the highest recommendation to this room/house/ and robin to anyone!! thank you robin as well as airbnb!! sincerely-daniel :-)

556729,3923220,2013-03-27,1723204,Ines,"too bad we only stayed one night! we felt very welcome and comfortable at robin's place and can only confirm what others said already - very kind host, super comfy and clean bed, adorable curious dog mitzy and the bus stops of the 70 and 79 lines were very convenient to get to the national mall / chinatown, and it's not even a mile to walk to 9:30 club!
robin knows the area very well and having heard that i'm vegan, she suggested checking out a vegan soul food restaurant just down the street - best food i've had in a while, even my carnivore boyfriend thought so ;-) thanks for everything, we'd definitely stay again!"
556729,4053770,2013-04-06,3189439,Patrick,robin is a fantastic host and was very welcoming whilst i stayed there with my girlfriend. i would recommend anyone to stay here as it was very accessible and robin provides everything that you need whilst staying here.

"
556729,4773329,2013-05-25,5988901,Frank,"we stayed in a very charming room in robin's equally charming house. besides robin, we met three other guests who were staying in the house, all very friendly.

in the room there was lots of information about washington, and two smartrip rechargable public transport cards for us to use, very convenient. a bus takes you to the national archive (near the national mall) in about 15 minutes, and goes pretty frequently.

we didn't really like the bed, as the mattress was old, and had a hole in it that had been tried to mitigate by stuffing something in it and adding a foam layer over the mattress that made things worse though, at least for our taste. we told robin about this, and she said she hadn't had any complaints before, but might replace the mattress in the future. i think that would be a good idea.

robin, thanks for sharing your nice house, we had a great time in washington!

"
556729,5216653,2013-06-18,6274280,Olek,"cozy room upstairs, located in quiet neighborhood. close to bus which is going directly to national mall. subway is a little far - about 15 min walking.
room big enough, with one duble bed, bathroom just next to room's door.
robin is a very friendly host. she tell us tips about area and also explained the easiest ways to travel around city.
watch out for very friendly dog in this house :)
i would recommend staying in robin's house and i will stay again if next time in dc. "

556729,5801481,2013-07-16,2589842,Brian,robyn was very kind and her room was a perfect fit for my needs. she gave me information on the local cycling scene and even had a few free bus passes available for me to use. her dog was very sweet and kept me company from time to time while i was in the house. 
556729,5852378,2013-07-19,2852897,James,"robin was responsive to questions. fun funky house with other renters.  a/c worked well during our hot weather visit!  bed was overly soft and morning traffic noise noticeable from our room. safe neighborhood.  limited free (unzoned) parking, but we got a spot on the same block for our vehicle. "
556729,6109090,2013-07-30,5398707,Diana,"nice place! some people said columbia heights was a ""bad neighbourhood"", but we didn't think so at all. it was 15 min walk to subway, but we could have taken a bus just outside if we had wanted to. "
556729,6184772,2013-08-02,4066202,Paige,"this rowhouse room was spacious, with a walk-in closet and room for a settee and coffee table (with television). it's right next to the restroom and we were set up with fresh towels and shower sundries. robin was very accommodating; though our schedules conflicted and we didn't get to meet, she fielded several calls from me and helpfully answered any questions. her dog, mitzy, was a great companion while we settled in and referenced the many maps and dc-related books robin set out on the coffee table; very well-behaved and social. also, robin, thanks for the use of your wifi! it was an amenity i wasn't expecting but was pleased to have. very enjoyable airbnb experience, and the city was very accessible from robin's location."
556729,9418314,2013-12-28,6231850,Patrick,"i stayed 3 months at robin's and felt very welcome from the first day on. robin is very hospitable and relaxed. it was no problem for my girlfriend and a friend to stay for some days with me. besides robin there are two other long term roommates who are also very cool. they have their own bathroom so you just share the kitchen with them. usually there is another airbnb guest in the third bedroom upstairs, but i never had problems to get into the bathroom in the morning to go to work in time. robin's dog mitzy is lovely, she is a little bit crazy but definitely just cute and not scary. there is wifi, a washer and a dryer and you can use the whole kitchen equiptment. after all i would definitely recommend robin's appartment. it is not directly situated near a metro, but buses are going directly in front of the house.

it was a great stay, i highly recommend natasha's place to anyone.
"
560341,7129307,2013-09-07,3087716,Joe,"natasha is a gracious host. she was flexible with my arrival time and assisted me in navigating my way from downtown dc to her beautiful home. multiple bus lines run from near the house to central dc, making my work commute simple with interesting scenery. the room was well-appointed, clean, and peaceful. 

beyond the amenities, natasha and her family are warm and inviting. it is nice to wake up in the morning and have an intriguing breakfast conversation, which we did multiple times. and this was topped off with an invitation to play the grand piano for a while. all in all an excellent stay!!"
560341,7480671,2013-09-22,6930546,Marti,"the room - i have no complaints about the room, it was very nice with a comfortable bed.

the location - you must have a car or be an avid biker to commute in a timely fashion from this location.  it is a beautiful area with a lovely park and deer that roam the streets, but is not within walking distance of any restaurants or grocery stores.  i was unhappy with the location because i did not have a car, and this is partially my fault for not realizing how remote the location is.

the kitchen - when i arrived there were hundreds of fruit flies in the kitchen that made it difficult for me to want to cook in the kitchen.  this was essential given i planned on staying for 3 months.  when i brought this up with the host she did not see it as an issue and that is where we had an impasse.  if you plan on staying for long, try to get the apartment that comes with its own kitchen.  

the host - natasha was generally helpful, but seemed insulted when i mentioned the flies and made a half-hearted attempt to get rid of them.  after contacting airbnb about the fruit fly situation any communication i had with her was tense and cordial at most.

conclusion - if you are staying for a few days and have a car, this is a great place. if you are staying for a few months, like to cook, and don't have a car this is not the place for you. i terminated my stay early. "
560341,7615949,2013-09-26,8828561,Andreas,"natasha was a very kind host. it was nice talking to her and she was very helpful if there were some questions from my side. 
the room was cute and comfortable. the bathroom was clean. 
she provided us a map and explained how to visit all the favourite buildings and parks in quite a short time.

if i visit washington again i would ask her to host me again. "
560341,7658908,2013-09-28,8960809,Siddique,"i do not have words to describe this beautiful host natasha. she is an extremely professional and lovable person.right from the start natasha guided well on reaching the nearest metro station and she took the pains to come an pick me up. she has a lovely house with the best 5 star facilities once can expect like best class room, kitchen huge lounge, tv, wifi and a very friendly house. a very beautiful house setting like a retreat in the middle of the city. i actually saw a family of deers outside her house. she was kind to even give me a lift to & from the metro station many times.she also guided me well on areas to visit , transportation and even discount shopping areas. i will definitely come back again soon and also highly recommend the place to my friends.she was like family and felt at home.."
560341,7803504,2013-10-03,7186659,Michael,"staying with natasha was absolutely ideal.  upon arrival, she provided an extensive tour of the house, which is nestled in a very nice neighborhood in dc, and was very welcoming overall.  beautiful place, with a baby grand in the main space and plenty of room for one to make themselves comfortable.  i would definitely recommend staying here, and plan to myself should i ever visit the area in the future.

the fridge was filled with fresh fruits and other good stuff, so we were equiped for the whole 3 day stay.
the place is located just perfect - 3 minutes by feet to the bike rental place (our favorite, if we could only have rented 6 bikes on two credit cards wich was not possible - only two bike per card are allowed!!), 8 minutes to the train station and 20 minutes to the mall if you like walking. nice neighborhood.
best for a couple and 3 childs or two couples. very clean and tastefully furnished.

thank you so much for such a wonderful stay at your dc apartment. my husband and i arrived and found the apartment in wonderful condition. the location is great. we were close to union station and other points in ne and nw dc. the apartment was very clean, modern, very spacious and quiet.  it was just two of us traveling but the apartment can easily accommodate 2 more people easily. russell met us soon after we arrived to go through specifics about the location, give us a street parking pass and answer any question we may have had. he was available when we needed him.  

the refrigerator contained yogurt, bagels and cream cheese and wine.  there were even snacks like chips and crackers awaiting our arrival. there was coffee available for us and there were plenty of cookware available for us. wifi was available and easy to log on. all of this such a nice pleasant surprise when traveling in from out of town.

we recommend this location and apartment without reservation. we will definitely be back and thank you so much for your hospitality!"

561697,2867203,2012-11-12,952652,Leiam,"russ' comfortable english basement flat was the perfect space for my stay. i was in dc for the weekend and needed a location that was near public transit and could accommodate several people at night. the space ended up being much larger than expected and had more than one could want from a rental. russ was thorough with introducing us to the apartment and had many ""extras"" for us to enjoy, i.e., snacks, drinks, local suggestions for eateries &c. if i needed this type of accommodation again i would absolutely return to russ' space and would recommend it to anyone else who is travelling for vacation in dc."
561697,3532487,2013-02-13,663182,Jo,"our family of 3 stayed in this rental for one month from mid-january thru mid-february so we got to know it and the area very well. the rental is a brownstone basement unit accurately pictured in the photos posted. the hosts are caring of their guests, attentive and accommodating. the unit is in an area called eckington close to transportation, the major tourist attractions, local eateries,  a grocer, a pharmacy & a starbucks. the neighborhood is up & coming, but is still a slightly dodgy area and i would caution walking alone after dark. the host cautioned us of this as well. the washer/dryer is a plus for long stays and for families. it is a clean quiet unit, with great water pressure, (has it's own water heater) well lit, has generous storage & full size appliances. (although i would have liked to have had a proper vacuum.) the sofa bed works for a child, but i'm doubtful an adult would find it comfortable for sleeping. netflix is on the television in the living room, but sometimes it didn't work. the television in the bedroom was great for movie channels. the wifi worked most of the time. when the electronics didn't work, the hosts were quick to remedy the situation. there were lovely touches when we checked-in, such as a stocked fridge & a desk full of pamphlets/books of local attractions. and the host met us upon arrival. the downside is that the unit does not have an independent hvac system separate from the host's home above, so we could not control our own heat. we would text, email or phone the host when we needed more heat. having a combined hvac unit also meant that any cooking odors or smoking odors would also be vented down to the basement rental unit. cooking odors were acceptable to us, but smoke was not. when we contacted the host regarding the smoke, they stated that they did not smoke themselves, but that they had a friend who was staying with them who did. we were informed that the friend's stay was temporary, but we did experience smoke again after that. upon contacting the host a second time, we were then told that it must have come in from the neighbor's home. this seemed unlikely to us & it seemed that the smoke was entering directly through the hvac vents. this rental unit is listed as ""non-smoking"" in the ""amenities"" section. the host did offer to have the rental cleaned at no charge during our stay, but with a napping child we preferred our privacy, so we cleaned ourselves. the furniture did smell of smoke to us. i feel it fair to take away 1 star for the hvac system & 1 for the semi-dodgy area. otherwise the unit is very nice as well as the hosts!

561697,3663895,2013-03-01,427770,Brenda,"will and russ are the perfect hosts. they have thought of everything ahead of time, but still check in just to be sure in case you have any needs they may have overlooked. the bed was super comfortable, and the pull-outs in the living room were also surprisingly nice, with great linens. we were in town for business on capitol hill, and the location was great for that – just a short walk to the metro, and then only one stop from union station. and the parking pass is an extremely valuable accessory as anyone who has recently stayed in a dc hotel will know! this option saved my nonprofit organization money and we would definitely do it again!"
561697,3802389,2013-03-16,2772424,Brooke,"we stayed at will and russ' place for three nights. there were just two of us, but the place was great--certainly could have fit plenty of more people! the place was immaculate, the bed was comfy--no complaints! it was great to get access to cable and also netflix streaming on the two tvs in the place. will and russ made us feel very comfortable and were great about responding to any questions or problems that popped up over the course of our stay. we would absolutely stay with them again!"
561697,3857222,2013-03-21,1753586,Ike,"this experience at his place was amazing. my fiance loved it more than i did because it was her first time going on a trip and staying at a place using airbnb. russell treated his place better than a hotel. we had all the privacy needed and the place was very clean. what really did it was how he bought us water, coffee, breakfast, extra snacks and let us us his cable/hulu/netflix during our stay. he even picked us up from the station and arranged for a taxi to drop us off at the airport. plus he drove us around giving us a tour of the area we were staying in and giving us pointers on where to go and how to get there. a true gentleman. also will (his friend and other person in charge of the place) was available 24 hours of the day via cell phone just like russell was. there was a problem with the hot water but they had it fixed in literally 3 minutes so no complaints there. the place is bigger than what pictures they have posted on here and honestly it felt too big for just 2 people. the couches in the living room are all pull out beds (3 couches which mean could sleep and extra 3-4 people). and it was affordable and walking distance to the metro station and 2 bus stops are right close to the place. and the area is real safe. you would have no regrets renting this place"
561697,3917073,2013-03-27,2833668,Jeff,russ was a great host.  he went way beyond what we expected.   staying at his place was so much better and less expensive than staying in a hotel.  if we return to washington dc anytime in the future we would definitely choose to stay with russ!
561697,3944885,2013-03-29,5323168,Jiali,"the place is quite big,  it is good for one family, russell is so kind to welcome us and give us many advises, hope stay there next time!"
561697,4000860,2013-04-02,349760,Nadine,"my family and i stayed 3 nights in russel's basement apartment . we are a family of 4 with 2 children age 3 and 8 and we found the apartment absolutely charming and very convenient for a family. the children were each sleeping into the 2 convertible chairs in the living room while we slept  in the bedroom and its  fantastic king size bed ! the bedroom is also equipped with a tv and you have access to the kitchen without waking up the children. the apartment is about 10 mn walk (with small children) from the nearest subway station , the area is nice and safe, possible grocery shopping near the subway station for cooking in the apartment, it was ideal for us. "
561697,4080284,2013-04-08,5420092,Gabriela,"the apartment was reasonably priced, in a good location, clean, and very nicely maintained.  it is located under another unit which makes for a bit of extra noise at times but not terrible.  the hosts were very gracious and provided a nice welcome, along with some included beverages and snacks upon arrival.  although there's no thermostat to control the temperature, the hosts were very accommodating to any requests to adjust the temperature in the unit.  although i was the only one staying there, this apartment can accommodate a few more people, which is a nice benefit for a small group.  i would definitely consider staying here again, it felt like a home away from home."
561697,4119629,2013-04-11,5562437,Robert,"charming hosts, apartment spotlessly clean, spacious and well stocked. the bottle of wine was a nice touch and well appreciated. the nearby neighbourhood may appear a little rough but i never felt threatened even walking with a briefcase and wearing a suit with a pink shirt looking for a cab! location wise, although it might seem slightly out of the 'action' it was only a 7/8 dollar cab ride to the convention centre which took about 10 mins so ideally positioned for those whose don't want to be ripped off by the ridiculous dc hotel prices. certainly happy to stay there again on any return trip."
561697,4154105,2013-04-14,4549367,Kimberly,"this charming space was a real treat in comparison to dc hotels.  russ and will could not have been more accommodating particularly when my associate was arriving early and i needed to check out late for a late flight.  incredibly spacious and well appointed and it made a long day in dc seem far away when you ""got home"".  we stopped at the nearby grocery store and bought snacks and basics but it was unnecessary as our generous hosts already had all of that covered when we got there!  this is a very thoughtful host who truly cares that  the needs of their guests are met. would definitely recommend this especially for a family or friends traveling together.  i hope to come back and take russ up on his offer of a backyard bbq since i am certain it would be as lovely as everything else.  kim & allyson april 2013"
561697,4194796,2013-04-17,5006315,Philippe,"l'appartement est situé en sous-sol d'une belle maison mais on y accède directement de l'extérieur. il est spacieux et agréable et très bien situé pour visiter le centre de dc mais il est limité à 5 pers. russell est très sympa et fera tout pour vous faciliter la vie. to sum-up, it is a beautiful apartment, very close to the main sites. it is better for 5 than 6 persons but it remains possible at 6. russell is realy a nice person that will do his best to facilitate your  stay.

561697,4276392,2013-04-23,993500,Jon,"all i can say is these guys rock.  the place was perfect and just what they said it was.  it was so clean i hated messing it up.  the snacks they left were great and they were there to answer any questions and give great ideas about the dc area.  wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when i go back.  thanks guys for sharing your great place with us.

561697,4361234,2013-04-30,5451301,Kari,our stay was great.  we enjoyed the nice touches such as the snacks and drinks we had access to along with the complimentary bottle of wine.  it was much roomier (and cheaper) than staying at one of the dc hotels for our 5 night stay.  will & russ made sure we were comfortable and were willing to answer our questions about what restaurants/bars to visit in their neighborhood. it was well worth the 5-10 minute walk to the metro station to save a little money on lodging expenses.  we enjoyed our time and would book again.  
561697,4400335,2013-05-02,6129268,James,"the place is very easy to find and get too from the central station. we were met on arrival by will who took us through everything to do with their apartment. after that we were left to our own devises unless we had any queries which will and russell tended to immediately. the apartment was spacious, immaculate and very comfortable, will and russ were great hosts and we would defiantly recommend their place. james & amy"
561697,4519861,2013-05-10,3180762,Holly,"fantastic stay! will and russ were perfect hosts! always very easy to get in touch with both during booking and throughout our stay. apt was very clean and perfectly sized for 5 women staying here. they provide key code so you don't need to worry about carrying or losing keys. very comfy king-size bed. comfy enough fold out love-seat & chairs in living room. all beds have quality pillows and comforters. well-stocked kitchen meant we had bagels, yogurt, eggs, fruit and juice for breakfast and plenty of other snacks to grab on the go- even a bottle of wine to enjoy at the end of the day! they also had tons of great info about local hot spots, nightlife & attractions, but as we were in town for business, we didn't get to take advantage of that much. i hope to visit dc  for fun soon with my husband & daughter and when i do, i would definitely book with russ & will again! "
561697,4570736,2013-05-13,1639820,Lakeysha,"will and russ are two great hosts, who checked on us and welcomed my boyfriend patric and me to washington, dc. the downstairs one bedroom apartment, in the brownstone was large and accommodating, for a couple or a family alike. my boyfriend and i were grateful for the kitchen being stocked with yogurt, juice, water and coffee and other compliments; this was such a sweet and kind gesture. the neighborhood is safe, near the metro and attractions within the dc area. russ was such a nice and gracious host, taking us around the surrounding neighborhood and washington, dc. we cannot wait to come back to dc and stay at this wonderful brownstone! will thank you for advising us about (website hidden by airbnb) to get cabs, black cars and suvs fast. we cannot wait to come back to dc and stay at this wonderful brownstone! russ and will thank your hospitality and welcoming us, to your beautiful brownstone and washington, dc!

my friends from mexico city enjoyed a lot staying there; we all think this was our best option for our vacation in dc. if i would visit again, i`d definitely book with them. 
they both were extremely kind to us... our flight arrived very late at night and they were there, waiting for us to arrive and give us all the info we`d need to make ourselves feel like we were at home.

561697,5559171,2013-07-06,170451,George,"we really enjoyed our stay at will and russell's rental apartment.  they were welcomed us when we arrived and showed us everything that the apartment offered, even including some bottled water and bottled juices.  it was nice to have a kitchen to cook some breakfast in the morning.

the metro station closest to the apartment is about 0.45 miles away and it was fairly easy to walk there.  also there is a harris teeter a block away from the metro station (noma/florida ave.) where we were able to pick up some supplies.  will and russell provided shampoo, bath soap, and laundry detergent.  there are two tvs which kept our daughter entertained while we were able to watch our own programs in the bedroom.

kudos to will and russell also for providing thread and needle to help us mend some clothing during out stay.

bottom line:  we will definitely stay at this rental the next time we are in dc!"

561697,6832503,2013-08-26,8217392,Bernard,"allow me to start off by saying what an amazing & beautiful space this really is. this is a perfect example of what a bed & breakfast should really be. the host was absolutely wonderful & attended to all of our needs. the amenities in the apartment were more than we expected or even needed. we had breakfast, lunch & dinner in the apartment because it was so warm, cozy & just available for our comfort. the one time that we went out to eat, we ended up bringing the food ""home"" to the apartment because it was just so comfortable eating there. the location is just great. we drove my car to dc, parked in front of the apt for free & walked to the metro train station just a few short blocks away.  there were several eatery choices very near by and a lovely wine shop. by the way, upon entering the apt we were greated by mr. russell & a lovely bottle of wine & a wine opener w/the appropriate wine glasses!!! mr. russell & mr. will called & stopped by to ensure that we were satisfied with everything. i'm sure we will remain friends as i've found a new home in dc!!!!  may i also say that i was very impressed with the fine taste in furniture in each room....., just breath taking!!!! the neighborhood was safe, clean and the neighbor's that we saw seem to know will & russ & were very pleasant.  there is sooooo much more that i can say, but at the risk of going on & on.....,, i'll end by saying ""excellent, tens accorss the board,  thumbs up, bravo & i will be back real soon!!!! thanks russell, will and air bnb."

the nearest tube station is a 5 - 10 minute walk. 
russell was extremly helpful. he showed us the local supermarket and the near by bar/restaurant hot spot which came in very handy.

note: if you are visiting in the summer i recommend bug spray as there is a lot of plants up and down the road which does unfortunately mean midges. my friend and i got a few bites but we got some spray and that definately helped!

very much recommend staying with russ for your visit to dc"

there was 3 of us traveling together so having the extra space with the beds in the lounge room was perfect for us.

the place was great, really cozy and full of amenities - if i had stayed for longer i definitely would have had reason to use the washer/dryer or the metro passes. they even asked what kind of wine i liked and left me a complimentary bottle! i used my car a lot and was always able to find parking on the street, day or night.

"
610655,3175646,2012-12-28,518010,Roger,"clean listing filled with great amenities at a great value. being on the bus line made it quite convenient for connecting to metro transit, and for anyone with their own vehicle, there is plenty of parking across the street one block down. we quite enjoyed our stay, specially the bath-tub with water-jets and the high definition programming on the television. host is friendly, prompt and professional in communication.

"
610655,3526296,2013-02-12,4532377,Kateřina,"even though we did´t meet deon at all, organization of our arrival and departure was perfect and our stay in his apprtment was great. the appartment was beautiful, cosy and clean. the building itself was very nice and luxurious. neighborhood was quiet and safe, just a distance from city center could be shorter (it took us more than half an hour by train and bus to get to national mall)."

juste un petit bémol par rapport à l'annonce : le couchage est effectif pour 2 personnes et à la limite un jeune enfant car il y a juste un lit 2 places et un canapé non convertible. "
610655,3927378,2013-03-28,378466,Rose,deon couldn't have been more helpful getting us around dc! i can't say enough about how available & gracious he was. his lovely condo was large & very accommodating for my teen daughter & myself. we had no problem with parking on the street. the price can't be beat. our thanks goes out to deon!
610655,4105827,2013-04-10,4598988,Serena,"deon's apartment was amazing. all the pictures were accurate and his place was extremely clean. as a host deon was attentive and very fast with his responses. 
all the monuments were easy to get to however it did take 45-60 minutes to get to them from where the apartment was. 
my experience in deon's place was very good."
610655,4227065,2013-04-20,3793700,Farzaneh,"deon answered all my questions before and after arrival promptly. his apartment had everything we needed for our stay, we didn't have to bring anything. his apartment was easily accessible via bus and metro. there were grocery stores nearby, but i just didn't like their atmosphere. no fresh fruit or vegetables and i had to talk to the cashiers through a thick glass wall.
overall, it was a good stay.   "
610655,4428224,2013-05-05,5008553,William,"deon was always very pleasant and quick to respond to any questions we had.  the condo was clean and neat and in good condition.  we never did find the off-street parking that was advertised, but were always able to find on-street parking immediately in front of the building.  altogether, we had a pleasant stay.  thank you, deon."
610655,4520077,2013-05-10,5879248,Maud,"it's has been awesome, deon has been very arranging, the apartment is beautiful, confortable, clean and very convenient. the bus is very close, but the night we need to take subway plus bus. 
the neighborhood is secure and the apartment is closed by electric sytem. parking is free in the street. it's was very funny. thanks deon."
610655,4561374,2013-05-13,4561190,William,deon was a great host. he stayed in contact prior to my arrival and was available during my stay. very nice and clean condo. this is a good location to stay at for a d.c. vaction!

610655,4844990,2013-05-28,1112346,Andrea,"the apartment was cozy and clean, and deon was a very attentive host. we had a great weekend in washington."
610655,4937180,2013-06-03,1022159,Ekaterina,"although we never met deon in person, communication over phone and email was excellent.

deon's apartment is a decent and clean, spacious place, equipped with a washing-drying machine and an air conditioner. there is a very comfortable double bed. the area is green, quiet and overall lovely, however, lacks cafes and food stores--it is a residential district. 

the apartment is indeed located in the downtown, but it takes about an hour or more to get to the main historical attractions by public transportation. there is only one bus that takes you directly to the city centre (metro city station, for example), #63, but it runs limited hours from 5.30 am to 10.30 am and from 3 pm to 6.30 pm. if you haven't managed to catch it during these hours, you have to use subway + bus, or two buses (#62 + change for another route), or walk about 10 min to the #64 bus stop--or taxi, which is not too expensive.

if you are about to book this apartment, consider renting a car to fully enjoy dc. "
610655,4994452,2013-06-06,1824356,Irina,"deon's apartment was amazing! you can find in the apartment practically everything you need during your stay - washing machine, iron, oven, air conditioning etc.etc. moreover, apartment is clean and cozy. but what is even more appreciated - deon is perfect host. he responded to any questions about flat and area, kindly sent me bus route map and kept in touch all time. neighborhood area is quite calm and safe. i would definitely advise this flat for rent!"
610655,5046356,2013-06-09,6734012,J R,deon was an excellent host. i literally booked the room within a few hours of my arrival. deon was very responsive and replied within minutes of my initial inquiry. i couldn't have asked for better accommodations. all amenities were provided for. it's was as if i stayed by a friends apartment. thx deon.
610655,5159960,2013-06-16,1525504,Laraine,"comfortable bed and blow-up mattress that my grandsons loved. all the basics, and clean, with everything we needed. the washer and dryer were especially appreciated! a few glitches, but deon immediately took care of the problems. there is a bus stop in front and it's less than a 10 minute ride to the takoma metro stop on the red line. "
610655,5282032,2013-06-22,134742,Pamela,"i loved deon's space! it was a much needed respite for me. great having an entire condo and all the amenities you could use for a short or extended stay! the area is very culturally mixed and undergoing incredible upward swing...loved the people and the proximity to every thing. i did not research enough to realize there were steps, so make sure you can go up and down with ease!!! :-) 
"
610655,5339372,2013-06-25,5536300,蕾Lei,"great host! we didn't meet deon, but he arranged everything perfectly. we really enjoy the time in his house. thank you very much for having us. "

610655,5576647,2013-07-07,4678124,Adrian,"deon was a terrific host: easy to communicate with and plenty of information given. the stay was comfortable and the condo is great. it's not the closest to public transit though so although we were happy to walk to the train, keep in mind that there is some distance. however you will be hard-pressed to find better value for what's on offer here. thanks deon. "
610655,5678327,2013-07-11,4256082,Adolfo,"deon's place rocks!!! his apartment is fully equipped and comfortable. his apartment was easily accessible via bus, however, i called taxis from there, since we were 4 in total, so it was faster and convenient. 
i never met him but we were in contact several times by email and text messages.he was so helpful, kind and friendly. great experience.
ps: the only con i could say is that unfortunately, i was not feeling super safe at night when i walked for getting some food. i didn't like their atmosphere."
610655,5859496,2013-07-20,4397791,Robin,"my stay was great.  deon was a great host.  he promptly responded to the numerous questions i had.  he provided suggestions for dining out and also emailed metro schedules i could use to get to my destination.  i was in dc for a convention and stayed 6 days.  the neighborhood was very quiet and convenient to public transportation.  the condo was comfortable and clean. it does have a flight of steps so navigating a lot of luggage might be a challenge.  overall, i had a great time and if i return to dc, i would stay there again."
610655,5900544,2013-07-21,7316939,Stanley,"deon was a great host, his condo is in great location. i will be using his condo again. "
610655,6005962,2013-07-26,5618063,Brandon,completely hassle free and met expectations.
610655,6148989,2013-08-01,5049037,Wendy,"i was traveling with my teenage sons (14 & 16) and we really enjoyed our stay at deon's.  everything was there that we needed to prepare simple meals, and relax for the evening.   the boys took turns sleeping on the couch and the inflatable mattress.  i took full advantage of the private bedroom.  we were out and about until late most evenings enjoying the cities sites.  and we took taxis from union station.

we opted for town cars through mat's who had a positive rating to get into the city in the mornings.  our first taxi experience, into town, was not good - we ended up going the very long way and spending well over the average $20.00 (including tip) that we paid from union station for taxis otherwise.  

deon was available for questions about everything and very accommodating.  he is a really great host."
610655,6349019,2013-08-09,6589706,Tammy,"deon was an excellent host!  his condo is exactly as it appears in the pictures, with the only exception being the couches.  they are the ones pictured however they are quite worn and are now covered with blankets.  the whirlpool bath was such a wonderful way to relax at the end of a busy sightseeing day! we were able to save a lot of money by staying at the condo...we cooked all our breakfasts and dinners there.  but unfortunately there is not a table of any kind to eat at, so we made do by covering our air mattress and using in as our table top.  not the best situation but it worked fine.  there were four of us, my husband and our two teenage daughters and there was more than enough room.  the condo was in a decent neighborhood, everyone we passed on the street was very friendly.  the condo building itself was very clean and fresh.  we felt very safe at all times.  just in case anyone needs to know to take a taxi from the condo to the national mall it is $22.00.  the metro from fort totten station runs about $2.25 each way and a taxi to the station from the condo is about $6.00.  unless it is a weekend do not plan on driving and leaving your car at the station lot it will be full! and there is no where to park on the streets.  our stay in dc was everything we hoped it would be!  the condo was a great home away from home, much better than a hotel!!  highly recommend this condo!"
610655,6405207,2013-08-11,7316939,Stanley,"deon is a great host, this my 2nd time using the space. this location is clean, roomy and convenient. "

610655,6643751,2013-08-19,4480387,Nuno,"condo was very cozy and roomy. the central air conditioning is a plus, as well as the jacuzzi bathtub... definitely helps to relax after a long day of sightseeing. the neighborhood is a very quiet residential neighborhood. there is a bus stop right across the street that takes you to the takoma metro station in like 5-10 minutes. from the metro station you can easily catch the red line metro which takes you right to the middle of washington dc in like 10-15 minutes. the condo has everything you need to cook food, although we practically ate out in dc most of the time. everything is pretty much as described."
610655,6701452,2013-08-21,6803141,Moritz And Iris,"everything was perfect!

610655,7641347,2013-09-28,3461903,Barbara,"the apt is very confortable and deon is a great host but i don't raccomende this apt because the area where it's located is not safe (all taxi driver say this when take us at home) and it's really difficult find a way to go to the center of washington because taxi didn't want to come in that area.. maybe next time i'll go in georgetown, a very nice area of washington dc.."
610655,7779029,2013-10-02,8804094,Tom,"deon was the perfect host, the place is spotless, quiet, and very private. easy to navigate via bus to 2 nearby metro stations to get you into the city. the downside is that the condo is not in a walk-able neighborhood to nearby restaurants, grocery stores."

620849,5545145,2013-07-05,6536485,Talisia,"great location, host, and apartment. walked everywhere (we like walking). we were a three person party & were comfortable and cooked in the apartment. would recommend! "
620849,5840644,2013-07-19,4731898,Lauren,"lish's apartment was great for my 5 day stay in washington. it had everything you needed and was actually bigger than i expected. it is in a great location that was safe to walk around, and walking distance to the white house (about 20-25 mins). it was really hot during my stay so i also appreciated the really efficient air conditioning! lish was fantastic as a host in communicating readily and providing lots of useful tips and information. i would recommend staying at her place."

620849,7562896,2013-09-24,7084912,Carmen,"my experience in lish's apartment was very good!! lish is a great host, very comunicative, helful and organized, so it made me feel very confortable.the location is excellent, you can walk to eveywhere, and the neighbourhood is in a good area close to restaurants and bars.
i would definitely recommend staying at lish's place!"
620849,7683260,2013-09-29,798802,David,"very good experience! the apt is a nicely appointed studio and lish was extremely well organized making us feel very comfortable in her place. she also gave us a list of bars and restaurants to check out in the area. the location is ideal to visit dc. from there, you are maybe a short 15-20 min walk from the white house / mall, you can walk to other areas like dupont circle / adams morgan or stay local in logan circle and enjoy the restaurants around 14th street. central location, comfortable apt and fantastic host for a great overall value."
620849,8396988,2013-10-28,9563719,Mick,"location, location, location!  the apartment is within 1-2 blocks of multiple restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.  it is a a 15-20 minute walk to most of the main museums and attractions.  apartment is perfect for 2-3 people and is functional and clean. overall great experience!"
620849,8631836,2013-11-09,8332117,Laura,"lish was a truly wonderful host!  she was thoughtful and communicative throughout my stay, very attentive to detail, super gracious, and made check-in and check-out easy and accommodating of my schedule.  her apartment is cozy and comfortable, and i loved the interior design!  i had an excellent experience staying at her place, and would highly recommend it to others."
626868,2869935,2012-11-12,3763944,Patrick,"i stayed at the cooper circle house with five friends (6 people total) and we fit comfortably in the three bedrooms upstairs. this spacious, open two story home is in an amazing location. the house is comfortable and has a cool industrial/modern style to it. it does not feel like i am house sitting someone's home, more like it was designed for guests, which i prefer. the back yard is beautiful and spacious. the downstairs dining, living, and kitchen rooms are open to each other providing a great flow for the residence, but there is still a sliding door divider if you seek to separate the dining room. austin was a wonderful and responsive host who provided a well presented information packet regarding the residence well ahead of time and accommodated special check in and check out needs for multiple guests. 

i highly recommend the cooper circle house. i will never forget my stay."
626868,4087587,2013-04-08,3058248,Albert,"my gf and i spent a weekend in april at austin's air bnb and had a great experience! austin greeted us at the door and allowed us to check-in early to drop our bags off before roaming around the city for the cherry blossom festival. the unit was very clean and brand new! large tv, huge marble table, big couch and brand new kitchen (we didn't use it tho). the bathroom was also brand new. the only downer was that the ceiling is a little low since it's in a basement. i only noticed it because i'm a bit on the taller side (6'1) but my gf didn't mind (she's 5'7).   overall, great experience and austin was very accommodating and responsive to us. i'd definitely stay here again. "
626868,4698465,2013-05-21,4153334,Pierre,"very nice apartment, very well equipped, located in a quiet and pleasant area. the rooms are large and spacious. the neighbors are hospitable and helpful. austin is attentive and responds quickly to our requests. we very strongly recommend this residence."

626868,7844888,2013-10-06,4352726,Kim-Maree,austin was a great host. attended to our requests in a timely manner and was a good communicator.
626868,8447894,2013-10-31,758614,Mallory,"austin was great and easy to communicate with. he responded quickly to all my correspondences.

it was awesome that there was a passcode for the door so we didn't have to arrange picking up or dropping off keys. the apartment was comfortable and the location was good for us - easy to catch buses or the metro to different areas of town we needed to get to. there was a little noise from the neighbors upstairs, but nothing that would prevent me from staying here again. "
627758,5147565,2013-06-15,5838705,Jim,"what a great little place and perfect location. just far enough from the noise of the city, yet close enough to some great shopping and nightlife in georgetown. mary beth was e perfect hostess. she went above and beyond in providing great suggestions for our sightseeing excursions. "
627758,8137206,2013-10-17,8951412,Flavia,mary beth was very nice with us. the house is really beautiful and confortable. we recommend this place for those who need quiet stay.
630062,4286127,2013-04-24,5478182,Janet,"the pictures do not lie!  six high school friends and i spent the weekend at austin's house in cooper circle.  we had an amazing time.  the house is well appointed and the kitchen is beautiful.  it was nicely renovated (with 2 full baths and powder room) and there was sufficient space for all of us.  it is conveniently located close (4 blocks) to the metro and from there you can go just about anywhere in dc.  several bus lines are around the corner.  we managed to pack our rented yukon in the designated space (with a bit of maneuvering off the alley).  this is a quiet residential neighborhood, so be prepared to walk to be entertained.  advice:  buy your groceries first if you don't want to move your car again.  we were surprised how hard it was to find a place to get milk early in the morning...although the ladies at dunkin' sold us two containers. there is a small (and pricey)organic shop nearby with irregular store hours.  austin has an assortment of spices and kitchen sundries, and a generous supply of dishes, glasses and pots.

everyone remarked how nice it was to be able to hang out, and sit in the living room or eat at the dining room table with our large group.  i would not hesitate to stay there again."
630062,7977631,2013-10-11,6874164,Pritam,great place and very efficient host. austin was very organised and quick to respond to any questions. lovely home with a spacious kitchen and high end appliances. would definitely recommend.
635399,2280665,2012-09-14,3162886,Frau,"strother was a very good host. in the apartment she prepared a binder with the most important information about dc and the apartment. even though we never meet, she replied right a way and answered all our questions. the apartment was very nice and clean. the location was perfect. we could walk to lincoln memorial and all the other sights. i would definitely recommend it!"
635399,2695604,2012-10-23,3005143,Dan,"strother's apartment is very well located just steps from dupont circle and i would recommend it to anyone traveling to dc. the booking process was very straightforward and strother was willing to accommodate our request for an earlier check-in time as well. access to the apartment was also no problem, with a concierge able to assist us with any key issues. all in all, a great place to stay in dc and a great host to do it with."
635399,2879261,2012-11-13,1367853,Catherine,"strother's home is located in a very good area (and within walking distance of the mall area - if you don't mind walking and want some exercise too!), close to pharmacy, restaurants, shopping, etc and with easy access to the metro (which we used alot - very easy to navigate and clean).  the apartment was very clean and the complex was quiet.  would recommend strother's place for a couple or single."
635399,3035730,2012-12-06,1570764,James,"very comfortable, light-filled space with great colors and lots of folk art.  the apartment is in the heart of dupont circle, on the 8th floor with nice views and quiet.  highly recommended.  "
635399,3751407,2013-03-11,5039458,Susan,"to all renters of sunny dupont  pied-à-terre:  be sure to get the correct keys from the staff!!  i wish i could give e. strother murray an excellent review.  sadly, i cannot.  strother murray's pied-à-terre was indeed sunny and would have been perfect had strother communicated adequately with the staff regarding the keys.  i was given the wrong set of keys by the staff with no warning or advice from strother about what this would mean. the key barely worked in the front door (my colleague never got the door open) and without the electronic pass my colleague and i both got stuck in the elevator in the wee morning hours. this was, frankly, terrifying.  the emergency button went to a recording that hung up after 30 seconds. strother murray has since changed the description of her place to reflect the necessity of getting the correct set of keys from the staff. this is because of what happened to me. it is indeed a beautiful thing to see that strother murray is making things more clear to airbnb folks. however, this does not address the fact that strother refused to take any responsibility for what she called the  'inconvenience.' while strother murray did apologize, i felt a partial refund was in order.  strother stated that because i did not contact her in time to correct the error, she did not bear responsibility.  i did not contact her during my 3 night stay because i did not realize the scope of the problem  until i got stuck in the elevator.  by that time my short stay was just about over.  it's never too late to do the right thing strother!"
635399,4002097,2013-04-02,5136553,Sawitree,"awesome location, easy check in and check out and the host is very very nice!!! highly recommended and will definitely stay here again."
635399,4114548,2013-04-11,4315197,Andrew,"your experience will only be as exceptional as your host.  strother was the perfect hostess.  she maintained communication though booked months in advance and had the arrangements made at the desk though unfortunately we were unable to meet.  the building is amazingly secure from the front door to the elevator (you need a pass key).  parking was no issue because strother obtained an on-the-street parking permit.  bad news/good news:  dc cleans streets on mondays and tuesdays so you are required to move your car to the other side on these days.  if not, you might be issued a $10 ticket.  we did not move the car.  because we had the permit and out-of-state plates, we weren't ticketed. in talking with some of the local residents, the police do not tow or boot (unless you have outstanding tickets or warrants). though, $10 to park three days in dc would have been a bargain.  strother's condo was fully equipped, colorfully decorated, comfortable bed, and clean!  it was neater than the pictures.  she had a bowl of fruit setting out for us and offered for us to partake of whatever the refrigerator offered.  she assembled a book that described the operation of the condo from wifi to tv to plumbing as well as offered suggestions for dinner, shopping, etc. the unit is a 3 minute walk to the dupont circle metro and the treats of the abounding connecticut avenue.  in over 30 years of visiting dc annually, this was our most enjoyable bedding experiences."
635399,4334699,2013-04-29,4901101,Nicole,"smother was a great host. her apartment was very clean, comfortable, and in a great location. she provided clear details about logistics of arriving/departing (keys, trash, information binder, etc...). she was very flexible with our departure time on the last day which was really helpful. i'd recommend staying here to anyone."

635399,5639689,2013-07-09,384010,Susan,we had a blast at strother's place!  the apartment was clean and sunny and was a welcome respite after a day of walking in 100 degree heat. the apartment was thoughtfully decorated with art from all over the world! her kitchen had all the accoutrements that we needed to create great meals. a nice little grocery store is about two blocks away.  the building was secure and well maintained.  dupont circle is a super cool area to explore and we were within one block of the metro station- big plus:)   strother herself was a gracious host and had a wealth of information to share about the neighborhood and dc in general. i would definitely stay again when we are back in dc.  thanks strother!!!!!!!!   susan and arianna
635399,7271601,2013-09-14,4519921,Sue,strother was a great host.  even though she wasn't there everything was organised perfectly.  her visitors information book was a great help and her apartment is set up well for visitors and was clean and tidy.  good position only a couple of blocks from dupont circle
635399,7546053,2013-09-24,5786170,Sanford,"strother's place was great.  the location was fabulous close to shopping, restaurants and the metro.  the place was as advertised and strother was a gracious host.  the apartment is fully stocked with everything we needed and strother left detailed instruction for everything and recommendation on things to do in the area.  we loved our visit here and strother's place was a real home away from home.  we highly recommend it and would used it again when we come back to dc."

653865,3402750,2013-01-23,4432601,Tonye,the house was very close to the tacoma metro station (red line). about a 5-10 minute walk. i walked to and from the station the whole weekend i was there. apparently there are cabs but you wont need them unless you need a ride at night. the house was very cozy. sheryl made me feel right at home. she offered breakfast and snacks. the room i stayed in was a bit small but thats because the other rooms were occupied. everyone minded their own business and the other tenant was very friendly. 
654835,4250603,2013-04-22,5421517,Krysten,"staying at this home was very convenient for our trip to washington , marybeth was very helpful and caring with whatever advice or questions we had. everything is at a walking distance , with a great transportation system to take you to where you want to go! the home was comfy and cozy, we would stay there again. thanks for everything we had a great trip!"

667954,2438526,2012-09-28,3359985,Amandine,"statying at rossen's home was fantastic!
we stayed only 2 nights, but that was enough to really enjoy it.

we felt immediately at home: we got a warm welcome from rossen, the place was great and very clean, the flat on a good location.

rossen told us about the must-see in wahsington and recommended us some good places to eat/drink.

and a bottle of wine was waiting for us in our room!! a nice detail that we really appreciated :).

definitely recommend to the air bnb members to book there when visiting washington.

"
667954,2498874,2012-10-03,3435418,Andrea S.,"going to rossen's apartment is like going to visit a good friend of yours living in washington d.c. in a clean and beautiful house.
l've been there with my girlfriend for one week, and everything has been perfect; he has been very friendly from the first moment, always helpful and nice giving us advices about interesting things to do or places to visit.
if we spent a good time in d.c. it is also thanks to rossen.
see you in rome!"
667954,2505520,2012-10-04,2163845,Cristian,"cosy room with an easy access to the city center. 
rossen is very friendly and helpful even if we barely saw each other. "
667954,2577225,2012-10-10,1841286,Madina,i loved my stay with rossen. even though he was not in town when i arrived he left all the instructions so i could feel myself comfortable in his apartment. very helpful and concern his guests. i will recommend his place to my friends and will absolutely stay there whenever i am in dc.
667954,2662045,2012-10-20,3234295,Samantha,"rossen is a great host and i enjoyed getting to know him during my time at his condo. his condo is beautifully decorated, cozy, and a very easy commute to all the great attractions in dc. he also has a very friendly dog zoe whose company i already miss!"
667954,2733273,2012-10-27,3913875,Luka,"i travelled to washington on business but on a tight budget so i chose to book my stay through airbnb. and boy am i lucky that i booked with rossen! 
i checked into the room at a time when rossen was at work, and he made sure i had all the information needed to get there (sent me a message, gave me a call, etc). when i got to the room, it was clean and everything was there as a preparation for my stay (including plug converters, which are brilliant for foreigners!). there was also a piece of paper with all the useful bits of information (wifi code, location of things in apartment, guide how to find tea and coffee, etc :) ).
this, however, is nothing compared to how wonderful rossen as a host is :) . he is warm and friendly and overall a great person to spend time with. also quite helpful - my portable bluetooth keyboard ran out of batteries and i forgot to buy some. he scoured his apartment looking for aaa batteries and found some for me!
so, all in all, i would heartily recommend staying with rossen - i'm sure you'll be happy. "
667954,2771656,2012-10-31,2430952,Cédric,"despite hurricane sandy which prevented us from visiting dc as we had wished, and though rossen was away during most of our stay, we enjoyed our time there and rossen's hospitality.

pluses
- nice, flexible and very accommodating host.
- quiet location, ideal to sleep well before and after a long day of walking (god knows how much you can walk around in dc!)
- comfortable living room with vod system in case you want to enjoy one last movie before going to bed
- you can bring your own food and cook if you want to
- very good quality-price relationship 

minuses
- expect 40 min walking to reach the us capitol / eastern part of the national mall, the metro will barely save you time... or rent a bike if the weather's fine.

 overall, this is definitely a good place to stay for a couple of days in dc!

667954,2795483,2012-11-03,1659076,Lindsey,"my brother and i stayed here for a couple days while road tripping the east coast - and found rossen's accommodations to be great! rossen was friendly, his place was affordable and it's in a good location for getting around. we only spent a little time with rossen, but he was really friendly and had lots of suggestions for cool places to check out.. that he thought we would like. i loved the location because it was only a mile or two to get down to downtown and because we like walking, it was perfect.

just heads up:  i probably wouldn't want to hang around at night by myself.. which probably isn't a smart idea in most bigger cities. i didn't really feel unsafe at all while there.. but i was also glad i wasn't alone. 

also, if you aren't traveling alone.. and you aren't planning on sharing the fouton - maybe bring an air mattress or a foam pad to sleep on.. my brother didn't mind the floor.. but i kinda felt bad

overall - great experience! perfect place to crash while in dc"

nous n'avons pas été déçu.

the bike path along the railway was a good way to walk in the city without being disturbed by any cars (or pretty much anyone else) and we also followed his neighborhood recommendations and tried out big bear café, aroi thai and boundary stone.

667954,4063711,2013-04-07,4861538,Christine,"rossen was a true host - he took time to talk to us and to introduce dc to us. very hardworking too as he provided a detailed list of recommendations before we arrived. he was also very generous and shared everything in his house with us. must say that we were very impressed! his place is very homely. although our room is a little small, there was space for both our luggages with room left for walking. although the walk to the metro is about 15min (asian pace), the route is pleasant. would definitely come back again!"
667954,4087876,2013-04-08,3636950,Doreen & Sebastian,"rossen was a great host! he made sure we had all the information we needed before we arrived, making check-in very easy. we didn't have much time to speak with rossen, but from the little we did he seemed like a great guy! 

rossen's apartment is located in a pleasant neighborhood. we enjoyed the walk from his apartment to the national mall (40 minutes), which allowed us to stroll through different dc neighborhoods along the way. 

we would definitely stay with rossen again next time we visit dc!"
667954,4103978,2013-04-09,590502,John,rossen is an easygoing host with a great place to stay. comfortable and great location. recommended.
667954,4175519,2013-04-15,1849229,Dave,"we were just about to book a hotel room when we saw rossen's room available. so glad we stayed here! within minutes of booking the room rossen sent over everything we needed to know about the apartment, neighborhood, transportation, where to eat/drink! the room is small but great for two people; even a closet to store your stuff. everything was super clean and easy to find. he was flexible with our check in time as well. we didn't meet him till later in the evening after we had checked in, but enjoyed chatting with him. the metro is a 10-12 minute walk, and we felt safe wherever we went. lots of interesting things to check out in the area! we would definitely stay with rossen again if we're in dc."
667954,4184614,2013-04-16,3121808,Igor,"we were only one night in washington dc and stayed at rossen's apartment. it was awesome! the building is located in very nice residential neighborhood with easy access to the center. we always walked there (about 25-30 mins), streets are beautiful and safety.
rossen is a great guy who sent us via email a full description of house rules, neighborhood cages/shops, map with direction and more. it was very useful. no doubt we'd like to stay here next time in dc."

667954,4636775,2013-05-17,4964445,Marret,"rossens place is amazing!
the room is very nice and we were welcomed to hangout in the livingroom and kitchen. he had everything and we were allowed to use all of his personal belongings. watching tv, drinking his coffee using his groceries. we really enjoyed talking to rossen in the night. he was very relaxed with cheking- in and out times. the area iks not the most intersting and you have to take the metro to get into town including a walk to the station. 
thanks rossen for having us."
667954,4709589,2013-05-21,755611,Glenn,"although i didn't meet rossen (he was away when i was there), he was superb at communicating everything about the apartment to me.  and he always answered within a few hours.  his place is nice, and only about a 10 minute walk from a subway station.  i enjoyed my short stay there very much."

the futon was pretty comfortable and the apartment was kept clean.  would highly recommend rossen's place and hope to be able to stay here if i'm in dc again."

667954,5756010,2013-07-15,6644281,Laura-Marie,"staying with rossen was a pleasant experience. he is a great host and well prepared for his guests. the room is tiny but has everything you need for a short stay in washington. we were provided with metrocards and tips for sightseeing, restaurants, supermarkets and whatever we needed. rossen is a really nice guy who welcomed us with a bottle of wine and always generously offered dinner, ice cream, tea, beer etc. we enjoyed some nice conversations while he did his back exercises :d he even got up early the day we left to give us a ride to the bus station! people told us that the neighborhood is not very nice, but everyone we met on the street was friendly and greeted us so we always felt safe and welcome. it was very hot when we stayed in washington so the way from the metro station to rossen's place sometimes felt a bit long, but it is actually well located and you can get everywhere with the metro. so all in all, a very nice experience. thanks for everything rossen!!!
ps: there a quite some kite surfing spots in costa rica, october through may ;)"
667954,5979887,2013-07-25,4826740,Gurkan,"rossen is a very kind host. he supplies a ton of information to find what you want and need in washington dc. the room was clean, the bed was comfortable. the neighbourhood is in walking distance to the next metro and i was feeling save during my stay there. 
i highly recommend to stay at rossens place. "
667954,6322399,2013-08-08,6764557,Henry,"rossen was a gracious host to my friend and me. he had everything ready for us and it was quick to settle in after a weary day of traveling. love his quick wifi which is a godsend for young on-the-move tourists. nicely decorated and furnished, rossen had almost everything one could think of when thinking about the comforts of home (comfortable couch, ps3, audio and video inputs, ac, stove, microwave, etc). he was also ready to dispell his knowledge of local pubs and bars and other forms of entertainment. it was great to meet him and stay at his place!

667954,7068266,2013-09-05,4584088,Guillaume,"the futon is good and rossen place is very nice.
i had the chance to meet rossen and some of his friends and discover new things about dc.
it is calm by night, but i would not go for a walk alone. i think it is me and the fact i am used to the security level of switzerland.
but if you are looking for a place to crash after a long day of walking and visiting touristic areas, this is definitely a great choice.

and rossen is a very nice and funny guy !"
667954,7118348,2013-09-07,7919517,Jessica,"the location: there was a giant construction site blocking an otherwise simple walk to the noma stop, so getting to the subway was a little bit of a pain and took longer than the 10 minutes. however, getting to the neighborhood itself was easy and felt like a safe suburban type of area. there are plenty of fast food choices around too!

the living: we were in a comfortable small room for a good deal. the futon was comfortable, clean sheets and towels all ready for us. the bathroom shower head had great pressure and he kept the bathroom very tidy. beware if you have cat allergies! he happened to cat sit the 3 days we were there, and my boyfriend had some bad allergic reactions, but otherwise it was comfortable and we liked it there a lot!

the host: rossen is great. he's extremely friendly and cordial and was just chilling, watching house of cards when we first met him. he had suggestions for us and offered coffee and tea. nice guy, highly recommend staying here!"
667954,7198338,2013-09-10,7884032,Sophia,"my brother and i stayed here for 2 nights and we had a great time. the place is clean and well maintained. it is in a pretty safe residential area, away from the busy downtown but only one metro stop away from union station. rossen is a great host, very generous, friendly and helpful. we highly recommend the place!"

his house is absolutely amazing. it has fully equipped kitchen and bathroom. the guest room is clean and comfortable. 
the neighborhood is very lovely. it's quite and safe. located just 10 minutes walking to the nearest metro station noma from where you can get to the city center (less than 10 minutes by train).
i will definitely stay at this place while my next trip to d.c.

667954,8163227,2013-10-18,4699923,Matthew,"rossen was easy to get along with and the house was comfortable. the room is nice, has the required facilities and is pleasant enough. the neighborhood isn't the best, and, having lived in dc for several years, i can say that many people would be concerned about going to and from at night. that being said, i didn't have any problems and there is a bus stop that drops off very close to the apartment. while the accomodation was fine, the loud sex coming from another room in the apartment one night did make it difficult to relax/sleep."

finally, as we were leaving, roya surprised us with 2 cd's of her own music, she is a professional santur player, so we listened her beautiful meditative music all the way on our long trip. 
we will definitely rent her place next time we go to dc, and highly recommend it to anybody visiting."

669941,3483702,2013-02-05,4794837,James,"this place is great - good neighborhood that's close to a bunch of cool stuff, and close the the train/bus for getting to museums, monuments, etc.  i had awesome running routes every day too.  good stores in the neighborhood too (some lame chains, but some great restaurants etc, plus a full giant grocery).  

the space is nice too - big enough for 2 people, everything is in good shape, great wi-fi, etc.  and roya was both nice and really helpful - i had changes in arrival and departure times, and she accommodated both.  plus left some breakfast food and drinks in the fridge.

this really is spacious and the huge walk in closet was exceptional.
 roya was very friendly and helpful without being intrusive. she had put basic foods such as fruit, yogurts and croissants in  the kitchen which was a lovely welcome. i would definitely rent this again if in the area!
 the large modern tv and wifi made this feel easy to call home."
669941,3703005,2013-03-05,5130585,Ellen,"this was our first trip to washington d.c, and our first time using airbnb...on both counts we were highly impressed!  roya's apartment was exactly as described...comfortable, clean, spacious, well equipped and a beautiful and light-filled home away from home.  she was a wonderful host and incredibly accommodating by making our arrival very easy, as if we were being greeted by a friend or relative, and was also very flexible about our check in and check out times. she left some goodies for us in the full-size fridge ""to get us started"", made excellent restaurant suggestions and drew us a map by hand so we could get our bearings.  on our way out, she gave us a gift of cd's of her beautiful music and we were very touched.  we lacked for nothing in the apartment, perhaps only the time to enjoy it as we were out sight-seeing most of the day, and when we returned each night, we were greeted by a cozy, organized and well-appointed environment.  the bed was incredibly comfortable, as were the convertible sofas, the water pressure great, the kitchen amenities more than you could need, and we left the apartment each morning refreshed and renewed for our day's adventures.  the location is perfect, it has a wonderful neighbourhood feeling... we easily parked our car on the street with a parking pass that roya gave us and it was literally a few short minutes to the subway which conveniently took us everywhere we wanted to go.  this simplified our lives enormously as we didn't have to worry about difficult and expensive parking in d.c.  we loved the walk in closet as we were able to put away our clothes and luggage without feeling like we were surrounded by them, which often happens when you travel.  we didn't have a chance to watch tv!, or use the sound system for our ipod or iphone, but we certainly made use of the wifi internet to plan our days activities.  there was also a charming little backyard area that we would have loved to enjoy had there been more time and the weather a little warmer.  roya has simply thought of everything and we would definitely love to stay here again if we are in the area.   "
669941,4177726,2013-04-16,1246383,Valerie,"roya is an excellent host! she was accommodating, friendly, and flexible when my check in and check out times changed. her communication was excellent before, during, and after my stay. she provided some starting goodies in the kitchen, including fresh fruit and croissants, which was wonderful. she is a professional musician and presented me with two of her cd's as a lovely parting gift.

the apartment is spacious and well-kept. it's easy walking distance to the metro, restaurants, and stores.  if the weather is good, bikeshare is right around the corner.  i stayed for over a month and never needed a car. i would highly recommend roya's apartment to anyone looking to experience a real neighborhood while exploring the dc area. all in all, a great airbnb stay!"
669941,4608684,2013-05-15,431815,Sarah,my inlaws came from overseas and stayed in roya's apt for one month. she was a wonderful host and made them feel very comfortable. she made an extra effort to be sure they were comfortable and took an interest in their visit. we will definitely contact roya again for their next visit. 
669941,4650903,2013-05-18,6061519,Niall,"roya is a great host and her apartment is spacious and comfortable. we were travelling for a work conference and roya's apartment was ideally located. roya greeted us on arrival and the apartment was beautifully maintained and welcoming. she has prepared some basic information about the apartment and surrounding areas which made the stay really easy and you can access public transport and shared bicycles very easily. 

thank you for making us feel welcome - i would highly recommend staying here.

669941,4783771,2013-05-26,1458412,Susan,"roya's apartment was a quiet, cool oasis, convenient to everything. roya herself is  polite and helpful host. the apartment is spotless and uncluttered. the long hallway between the main space and bedroom allows more sleepingr privacy than you might expect in a 1-bedroom. lots of amenities (delicious croissants!), endless supply of hot water for fabulous showers after humid dc days, comfy linens and comforters. all for a very reasonable price. highly recommended!"
669941,4992129,2013-06-06,4802635,Teresa,"roya home is the perfect place to stay and visit while in dc. it has everything you could ever want. it is very clean, comfortable and quite. it very close to shops, resturants and the metro stop. she welcomed us with a tour of the place and left breakfast items and fresh juice for us. she gave us information and drew maps for us to help us locate and find things of interest. she is a wonderful host and i would highly reccomend her place. we will stay here again on our next trip.
thanks roya for everything

669941,5364659,2013-06-26,6369300,Lena,my family had a wonderful time in dc.  the apartment was just as described and so convenient.  a short walk to the metro and we could go anywhere in dc we wanted.  roya was very friendly and helpful.  she was always quick to respond when i had a question or needed directions.  we would definitely stay with her again.
669941,5556404,2013-07-06,5871410,Christophe And His Family,"très belle expérience.  roya est très accueillante.  l'appartement est situé près du metro.  l'appartement est spacieux et bien décoré.  très bien équipé, les pièces sont grandes et très confortables.  l'appartement est situé en sous sol.  un permis de stationnement fournie par roya est très apprécié."
669941,5728950,2013-07-14,4578962,Juliet,"we just returned from a week-long stay at roya's cute apartment and had a great time! the apartment was more than spacious enough for our family of three and had everything we needed for our stay. we didn't use the kitchen much since we were so busy, but it was very well equipped.  in addition, the apartment is nicely situated and the metro station was only a five minute walk. this allowed us to get everywhere we wanted quickly as it was just a few stops away from the national mall and a great number of major sights, museums and monuments.  in addition, we loved columbia heights.  there were a lot or convenient stores near the metro, and many great bars and restaurants throughout the neighborhood. (some of our favorites:  the heights, meridian pint, red rocks, sticky fingers, cava grill) lastly, roya couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating.  even before our visit, she was quick to offer advice and information. on our arrival took the time to draw us a map and get us oriented, and recommended many of the restaurants that we enjoyed during our stay. she was always extremely pleasant to work with.   we would love to stay with her again some time!  "
669941,5882235,2013-07-21,5741574,Joe,"roya's place worked great for us.  it was clean and spacious just as the listing described it.  the walk to the metro was short and we were able to get everywhere quickly.  the columbia heights area was very convenient.  the target store nearby had a nice grocery section.  on street parking was easy to find.  if you are visiting dc, we would definitely recommend roya's place."
669941,6169316,2013-08-02,5318637,Mads,"roya is an excellent host and the apartment is wonderful. everything was ready for us, and roya took good care of us. the apartment is very spacious - we were 5 persons without any problems. roya had made the apartment nice and clean for us. we enjoyed our stay very much. the metro is very close to the main events in washington d.c. we can surely recommend this place !!"
669941,6347564,2013-08-09,7144800,Shirley,"roya is a gracious host with attention to details. she makes you feel very welcome and is always on hand to answer any questions. her flat is clean, uncluttered and complete with everything you need. location is so near the train station, supermarket and restaurants. we had a great time in dc. "
669941,9341238,2013-12-23,952984,Johanna,"roya's place is wonderful. we stayed with her for five months. so we got to know her and we really got to know the apartment well.
the location is absolutely unbeatable! you will be staying 2 blocks from the metro station with all kinds of eateries. a couple of blocks the other way is 11th street with lots of restaurants and just down the hill is u street. dc is a great city to go out. we walked home from metro on our own at all times of the night and never had a problem. also, if you like walking, you can walk down to the national mall in 30 minutes and dupont in 20.
the apartment is super clean and very spacious with a walk-in closet and a very comfortable bed. roya provides you with everything from some breakfast to get you started, great tips to navigate the neighborhood to a nice selection of on-demand tv. the water pressure is indeed great, there is a great gas stove and all the cooking utensils you need and comfy futons to relax in the evening.
roya is a fantastic host. she tries (and succeeds) very hard to keep the appartment very clean and hygenic for all visitors. she is very accomodating and welcoming as well. she has been more than friendly to us and our little son, who she has been great and warm to. 

last but not least, she is an interesting woman who will give you her unique perspective on dc and all that is happening here. i can wholeheartedly recommend her places either for tourist visits or for longer stays."
674940,2588889,2012-10-12,2026033,Simone,"the apartment was perfectly appointed with all i needed: great toiletries, special surprises and even an umbrella (a treasure since i forgot my own).  the instructions left in the apartment for navigating the home and the city were priceless.  i had a wonderful stay!!"
674940,2632425,2012-10-16,3525739,Sharon,a great location and perfect accommodation for 2 people doing the sites. 
674940,2700481,2012-10-24,3511890,Cynthia,"this studio was wonderful and perfect in all ways,decorated beautifully, very clean, perfect location.  inside and out was just lovely.  we would stay there again in a heartbeat.  you really got the d.c. experiance being there.  having a nice kitchen with all the appliances one would need was so convenient.  we would spend our days exploring and some nights it was perfect to be able to make a sandwich and gear up for the next day and not have to go out for every meal.  the bed and bedding was first rate, and very comfortable.  the decor was cozy and very tasteful.  we also had a spot to park our rented car so we spent a couple of days in the country.  although, you could spend weeks in town and never see it all.  the location was perfect to walk to everything or just around the corner was the union station (beautiful) to catch a cab. it was easy to book. everyone was so helpful in every way. all in all, we are a retired couple who had the perfect adventure.  thank you"
674940,2782081,2012-11-01,3620463,Angie,"this was a great place to stay on our holiday to dc. i made an error on the dates initially booking via the website ... contacted charlotte via email and she was very quick to respond and to help fix my error!
the apartment is 5 / 10 min walk from union station and approx 10min walk to the mall / smithsonian tourist attractions, very well located! the photos look exactly like the real thing! no complaints whatsoever and highly recommended!"
674940,2855653,2012-11-11,2034511,Michael,"the accommodation was excellent.  
centrally located in dc with union station and the metro just five minutes walk.
we loved every minute. 
as for charlotte and kevin - they are just fantastic.  you couldn't find better property managers."
674940,2947874,2012-11-23,1675305,Lindsay,"we had a wonderful stay at capitol court. charlotte and the luxbnb team provided a great experience. the property is even better than the pictures. the location is away from any street noise, feels very safe, and is a short walk from union station.  there is a local market nearby and a great coffee shop just down the street. the property is in the perfect central spot for a trip to dc. we were able to spend the day seeing the sights, drop by to rest for a bit, and then head out again for the evening. i would highly recommend this rental to couples visiting the area. it’s the best combination of hotel amenities with a true local feel. reserving the room was easy and charlotte was quick to respond to any questions or concerns.  we had a fabulous time and can’t wait to visit again! "
674940,3229312,2013-01-02,61855,Mark,"we are a family of four who wanted a 1 bedroom within walking distance of the mall with a parking space.  this apartment was perfect - modestly sized, but well equipped with laundry and a nice kitchen.  very clean, well stocked with basic necessities.  the neighborhood has a fine friendly character even tho it is right on the edge of capitol hill with its mammoth federal office buildings.  extremely convenient for accessing dc by foot, transit (union station), or car.  host was very communicative prior to the visit - even authored and sent a short informative tourist guide.  highly recommended."
674940,3334088,2013-01-12,653497,Ellen,"could not have been a better experience.  it's obvious rodney (the owner) has taken great pains to think of everything you might need on your trip whether you're a tourist or business traveler as i am.  a day or two before i arrived, i asked if there was coffee for the coffee maker and when i got to the front door, was greeted with a little gift bag with coffee in it hanging on the door knob.  this place beats, by far, any dc hotel since the decor is just as nice if not nicer, and has more space, washer/dryer, kitchen, a really comfy bed, etc.  plus, charlotte and company are great to deal with -- they always email me right back and are so patient and helpful with any questions i have.  i give it my highest recommendation."
674940,3411388,2013-01-25,2884104,Kristján,"two of us stayed at the capitol court property for a week and we really liked the apartment. it was clean, nicely decorated and in the perfect location (only 2 min walk to the metro). i will definitely book it again next time i travel to d.c. charlotte was a great hostess and provided us with everything we needed. thanks again airbnb! kristjan"
674940,3502361,2013-02-09,4248163,Brad,"this apartment is the perfect place to stay while in dc. 
1 block away from union station, quiet and safe area. a couple of good restaurants very close. i will definitely be staying here again when i come back into town. 

the small touches like having coffee and tea in the kitchen was  a very welcome touch. 

thanks again. 
"
674940,3681634,2013-03-04,2401735,Nicole,"rodney's apartment is perfect. it was less than a 5 minute walk to union station which is ideal as most of the tours left from there. the apartment was immaculate and very clean.  the only very small negative was the shower, the shower head it didn't have much pressure.. rodney was also fantastic and was easily contactable. if anyone is looking to stay in washington dc i would recommend rodney's apartment."
674940,3946406,2013-03-30,4623202,Mike,"we loved our stay at capitol court.  it was very clean and updated.  the owner could not have been nicer and more helpful!!  we forgot our printout of a couple congressional tours, and rodney went out of his way to get them printed for us.  the location was perfect!!  it included a parking space, so we didn't have to pay extra for daily parking, and we were able to walk to union station metro only two blocks away.  we will definately stay at capitol court again when we are in d.c."
674940,4646310,2013-05-18,5280950,Kellie,"as a first time customer of airbnb, i couldn't have been more pleased with the experience. from the very beginning charlotte and her team were so helpful - as i didn't realize the apartment that i initially requested was booked that week - she quickly found us an even better option for a comparable price. this apartment is in the lower level of a cute town home just a block from union station - a perfect location to experience the town as a local but be quickly accessible to a variety of tourist spots. "
674940,5050570,2013-06-10,5524352,Suzanne,"what a wonderful experience we had staying at this apartment!  the property was so charming, and it had all the comforts of home.  it was very clean, the decor looked fresh and newly decorated, and the location felt very safe.  it was also nice having a very short walk to the union station metro.  before our trip, we were given an incredible amount of information about getting around dc along with other recommendations for neighborhood restaurants, markets, etc. rodney also checked in with us (email) after our arrival to make sure everything was running smoothly for us.  we would recommend this property in a heartbeat!!!"
674940,5556101,2013-07-06,4967927,Elizabeth,this was our second air bnb expereience. the first was fantastic so we were hopeful that our dc experience would be as good.  and indeed it was.  the photos and description of the place and amenities were accurate.  the owner was responsive to our questions and resolved a very minor problem for us immediately upon email request we hope to make this place our home away from home over the next four years.  
674940,5938850,2013-07-23,5267543,Kevin,"great place. great location. we made a combo business/vacation trip to dc where i worked for 1 day and then we brought our 10-year old son to see the sites. this place is in a great location, close to capital hill sites and accessible to the metro and bikeshare. "
674940,8124974,2013-10-16,4942868,Rob,"the place is exactly how it looks in the pictures.  it is clean and comfortable.  my contact for this place, rodney, was very responsive on text messages and would usually reply almost immediately.  there was everything that i needed for my trip in the place.  i was visiting friends in dc and annapolis, so i rented a car and i was able to get a great parking spot right outside my front door.  ask if it is available. this apartment is about a 10 minute walk from union station where you can catch the public transit and there are plenty of places to eat and shop.  the capitol building is also about a 10 minute walk away.   i would definitely stay here again.  "
694383,3947422,2013-03-30,3812973,Sidse,me and my parents had a wonderful stay with frances. she is super sweet and was excellent and fast in answering any inquiries and was very accommodating.her place is lovely and very cosy. i would recommend both the apartment and her for anyone visiting dc who wishes to stay a little outside of the innermost part of the city and thereby avoiding noise etc. 
694383,4066942,2013-04-07,4798046,Liting,"frances was so nice and helpful. she patiently answered every question i had and tried her best to make things as accommodating as possible.

the apartment was very spacious, clean and comfy too. everything we needed was there and we enjoyed our stay very much. the apartment building is located in a very quite and safe neighborhood where we were able relax and felt home. it's not far from the attractions - only 10min drive. bus stop right in front of the building towards downtown. restaurants and convenient store close by. my parents loved the place!

i highly recommend frances' apartment!"
694383,4610632,2013-05-15,1601803,Ann,frances' apartment was perfect for us. the location was ideal for our american university events and everything in the apartment was clean and updated. frances was extremely accommodating and went out of her way to help us with parking issues. i would be pleased to recommend this place to friends and other dc visitors.
694383,6657355,2013-08-20,1202118,Tiger,"perfect location if you're visiting american university. we dropped off our daughter for her freshman year and could easily walk to the campus. there's also a terrific little butcher/deli/bakery called wagshal's 5 minutes away to stock the fridge.

frances' place was ideal, very ikea cool. only quirk is that there's poor cell reception in the apartment if you're on at&t - but fixable if you open a window. (hardly mattered, though, as the wifi was fast and consistent making texting easy.)

we'd happily stay again."
702090,9318144,2013-12-21,9796556,Matthew,laura is very kind and quiet. her basement apartment is quaint and the private bathroom is brand new. overall very happy! great value!
713529,3365151,2013-01-17,1836767,Richard & Michelle,"this is a great place to stay while visiting the d.c. attractions.  dennis was very accommodating, quick to respond with any questions we had, and worked with us on our arrival time.  we agreed on arrival time of around 11pm and when we knocked on the door, dennis greeted us with a smile and handed us a parking pass that allowed us to park directly in front of the house...very convenient!  he gave us a tour of the house and told us to make ourselves at home.  his house was located extremely close to everything that we wanted to see on our trip.  also, it was only a 10 minute walk to the grocery store (safeway) and the green line metro. we really enjoyed the use of the living room and the kitchen, watching a movie on the super comfy couch and having a home cooked dinner was just what we needed to relax after a long day of site-seeing.  we were able to use the washer/dryer which is always an awesome bonus.  the bedroom was basic and all we needed for our stay, the bed was a bit small for the both of us but dennis did offer to set up the air mattress if we needed it.  the sheets were clean and the towels he provided were soft.  both bathrooms are remodeled and very nice.  the house was quiet at night and just an overall great experience.  thanks dennis for such a great stay!"
713529,3418984,2013-01-26,4315102,Rob,"dennis was a very helpful and nice guy! sorted us out with everything we needed in order to have a good stay! his house is awesome, but very cold at night time! we should have turned the heating on! but other than that, we had a great stay and would do it agin for sure. cheers dennis!"
713529,3490756,2013-02-06,4890833,Alberto,dennis and his place is the best a newcomer to washington dc can get.  very helpful and accommodating. place is conveniently located near the metro train but then i discovered i didn't need to take the train.  the bus comes right at the corner!
713529,3565050,2013-02-17,4881564,Christophe,"dennis was very kind with us as our coach from ny got delayed on friday evening and we arrived slightly before 1am (instead of 10pm). he waited for us without any complain, thanks a lot! unfortunately we left the morning after and did not have any time to talk with him and get good advices for our short trip. anyway, dennis is a good host and willing to do the best he can. "
713529,3578181,2013-02-18,5067985,Marie,the apartment has a great location and the room is very clean. the host explained to us all the places to go! i recommend !
713529,3590984,2013-02-19,49309,Daniel,dennis was great.  very responsive to emails and texts and accommodating of our schedule.  the metro is ~15 minute walk.
713529,3720409,2013-03-08,4595267,David,"host was welcoming and helpfull upon arrival. property was clean and comfortable. great location from which to visit downtown washington and the mall..only 1 1/2 mi. south of the capital. would recommend, location, location."
713529,3789420,2013-03-15,4532821,Irina,"we stayed with denis for two nights in march for a lightning visit to dc. the accommodation was exactly as advertised,  clean, friendly, and comfotable. denis also offered some good dc advice. "
713529,3827539,2013-03-18,3912591,Brendan,"very nice place, with a very gracious and accommodating host.  the room  is cozy and the bed is *very* comfortable.  i highly recommend it, and it is priced very fairly.  dennis, the host, is a very good guy and prompt at answering any queries via email and text."
713529,4044041,2013-04-05,5195313,Ginny And Ernest,"i'm a first time airbnb user and i was a littler leery and nervous when booking. when we first arrived an elderly woman showed us to our room and gave us the keys and towels for the bathroom. we immediately took a nap on the wonderful memory foam mattress. 

the next day we headed out to dc the metro station is maybe a 10 minute or so walk either the waterfront station or the navy yard/ballpark station. when the nationals are playing you are within a block of the game. the house is located in what seems to be a combination of a new rising neighborhood and a rougher part of town. however we walked around and back home after dark and were perfectly fine. overall this was great we had the place to ourself and his tv has internet built in which was great."
713529,4069313,2013-04-07,5195313,Ginny And Ernest,extended stay no issues
713529,4308291,2013-04-26,6077425,Jaime,"dennis was a great host. i had a last minute business trip in dc and he was flexible with my needs. i arrived late and left early which was no problem at all. his place is quiet, comfortable and clean, perfect for a business stay."
713529,4326097,2013-04-28,5694119,Marie Claire,denis was a welcoming and informative host. parking was ideally located in front of the house and a parking pass was provided (parking in washington (is limited and expensive!) we are a family with two young children and were able to go by foot to the city center (for those who enjoy walking). the room was comfortable and clean. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this location to others.
713529,4355520,2013-04-29,180244,Robin,"dennis is a fabulous host--super responsive and responsible. the interior of the house is everything he says it is--clean, cozy, and the bed is super comfortable. the only thing keeping me from giving him a perfect review is the location of the house. the neighborhood was not what we expected for the price we paid, and we were a little uneasy coming and going. my only suggestion is that if you are considering staying here (and it is lovely inside) take a look at the street view before deciding.
excellent location for ball games, and dennis offers a city-wide parking pass--worth gold!"
713529,4504639,2013-05-09,4636110,Rick,   our stay was perfect. dennis' location is great for a nationals game and the accommodations were clean and comfortable. highly recommend. thanks dennis.

713529,7433662,2013-09-20,7189005,Dirk,"i had a great stay with dennis.
the directions are easy to follow and i had no problems finding the place at any stage, using the ballpark as a reference point made it really easy. its a nice house and getting inside wasn't a problem without anyone being there. dennis communicated well and was helpful during my stay with anything i needed.
i'll be staying here again if i visit washington in the future and wold definitely recommend this place to others - especially if you're catching a baseball game as you're only a block away from the stadium."
713529,7670890,2013-09-29,276304,Karin,"dennis and his family were very friendly and hospitable, helpful with recommendations for restaurants and willing to look up any information we needed. the room and bed were fine. our only criticism is that the bathroom could have been a little cleaner, but it is small and there were 6 adults using it!"

713529,8386836,2013-10-28,9266205,Yodé,"dennis was a very friendly and flexible host and the room nice and really comfortable! 
indeed it's a good place for a baseball game but not really for a touristic weekend as the neighborhood was a little bit far away from the  things to see/do in washington dc. it seems also a little bit unsafe for women at night. but the house was easy to find and a good deal for baseball lovers who want to stay after a game!"
713529,8472401,2013-11-01,1155183,Kevin,dennis was a great host and the place was very clean and well located for my travel purpose.

thank you so  much!
"
713529,8742903,2013-11-15,8227254,Adriana,"dennis and his wife are great host. despite arriving late on my first night, dennis stayed up to wait for me and patiently explain how to get around in dc. 

when i was in dc, it was my 3rd week of traveling. the bed in dennis' place is by far the most comfortable bed i have slept in. i was feeling slightly under the weather during the second night so i tucked myself in early. dennis and his wife thoughtfully turned on the heater knowing that i might be feeling cold in the middle of the night. i can't say i am not touched by their kindness and thoughtfulness.

apart from that, dennis' place is conveniently located nearby all tourist destinations and public transportations are easily accessible.   i highly recommend dennis' place if you are looking for a decent place with comfortable bed and amazing host to stay."

713529,9185935,2013-12-11,5291555,Christine,"this is a convenient and friendly place to stay if you want/need to be near national's stadium or the sw area of washington, dc.  site is best for guests in their 20s or 30s, as the hosts are young too. there were a couple of requests i was compelled to make, and the hosts were positively responsive to my requests and eager to accommodate me.  queen bed was very comfortable.  no tv in room, unfortunately.  shared bathroom was adequate, but busy.  i was charged $69/night, for my off-season (winter) stay, and this seemed excessive to me considering that the room rental is very ""basic"" with no extras and no frills.  dennis and mariela are very nice people."
713529,9249333,2013-12-16,3681325,Maja And Chris,dennis and his wife are absolutely great. very helpful and friendly since the very beginning - they welcomed my polish-speaking parents with a lot of warmth and good advice. my parents had a wonderful first airb&b experience. not even mentioning how convenient is the location - walkable distance to all dc biggest attractions. i ended up accidentally stealing dennis' parking permit and he was still cool with that (i hope you got it back by now - sorry again!). awesome hosts - no 'buts'.
713529,9384644,2013-12-25,9327070,Anaïs,"c'était la 1ere fois que l'on utilisait airbnb, et ce fut une très bonne expérience grâce a dennis, son frère et sa femme. l'accueil fut chaleureux et dennis nous a très bien conseillé et orienté pour que nos visites soient parfaites. la chambre est un peu petite mais suffisante avec tout le nécessaire pour le séjour (placard de rangement, fer a repasser, chausson, serviette de bain ect....). 
la maison n'est pas loin du centre ville (métro à 10 minutes de marche). "
713529,9485677,2013-12-30,10641417,Aimee,"the place was clean and dennis was very nice and recommended things to do and see, which was helpful. the room is small, but if you are only there to sleep, it's a nice place. "

the apartment itself ,nice kitchen, very comfortable bed, very clean and very good size apartment ...you really feel at home.. 
walking distance to the metro station and giant supermarket.

joel was very helpful and friendly.

722114,3509835,2013-02-10,4667674,Diana,"i stayed at a few places through airbnb while i got settled into dc, and joel's was by far my favorite. 
the place was clean, comfortable, and in a great area. joel was also a great host. he was accommodating and very helpful since i was new to dc. 
when i came back from work, it always smelled yummy from something joel was cooking up, so it really feels like home. :)
overall, great place, location, and host!"

as a host, joel was perfect. he gave flexible time to arrive and leave, which was great because we came in from 6 hours away. he checked up during the travel there to make sure everythig was good during the drive; and while staying- checked in to make sure we knew he was available if there was anything we needed. all in all- perfect amount of hostipitality and the respect for our privacy:) i would suggest his place to stay to anyone.  "
722114,3791495,2013-03-15,5277210,Rachel,"joel was a great host when a colleague and i were in town on business.  his location was great since we needed to be close to rock creek park.  he was very helpful and receptive to our needs, and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable.  the apartment is the perfect ""bachelor pad"" studio, but was also great for my colleague and i .  i slept on the large bed and she slept on the awesome couch/bed.  "
722114,3872936,2013-03-23,5018656,Raquel,joel was a pleasant host--very responsive and helpful--and the apartment was as described. loved that it was dog friendly (joel even had a spare kennel) and close to everything.
722114,3995100,2013-04-02,1325226,Ahu,"joel is an extremely kind and accommodating host, who always stayed in touch during my stay. the apartment is conveniently located (only a short walk to the next metro metro station) and fully equipped with everything you might need during your stay (comfortable bed, couch, tv, internet, kitchen including fridge and oven, your own bathroom)."
722114,4063827,2013-04-07,5054606,Peter,"joel's place was a great base when in dc.  the apartment has everything you would need for a short stay (and more, the drum kit, pinball machine and stereo (linked to the wifi) were welcome perks!) and there was coffee, toiltetries etc as well.  the bed is really comfy the apartment is in a very quiet area.  we only stayed 4 days but could happily have stayed longer.  the metro is a few blocks away and there are some bars etc a short walk away as well.  would definitely stay again."
722114,4115970,2013-04-11,5029894,Julie,"a friend and i took up residence at joel's place while we were in town for a conference. it was super convenient from columbia heights metro but far enough away that it was on a lovely quiet street that seemed to be removed from the hustle of the city. the apt had everything we could possibly need - full kitchen, two comfy places to sleep, toiletries, and great funky ambiance. joel himself was incredibly flexible and quick to respond throughout the whole process. he made us feel right at home and if time had allowed, we would have loved to hang out. joel was super accommodating and fantastic and we totally recommend this place!!"
722114,4228440,2013-04-20,1935058,Avi,"very cool place with nice bed, big couch that doubled as another bed, speakers, kitchen, and more. great for 1-3 people, could do more in a pinch. neat area. joel was a very responsive host, accommodating and providing us with what we needed. thanks!"
722114,4298573,2013-04-26,4136740,Alette,"we loved joels' funky basement! from the moment we stepped in the door, we felt right at home. a nice, comfortable bed, a cool kitchen, a good stereo (on wich we could play our own music), nice television-set and of course the pinnball-machine! 
located in a quite part of washington, joels' place is a perfect spot to come 'home' to. joel is a nice, laidback kind of guy. he made us feel welcome and was a good host. 
warning: if you're over 2metres/6 ft tall, you'll be ducking sometimes (or rubbing your head). like my boyfriend did..."
722114,4359973,2013-04-30,3608212,Lexi,"joel was very great and accommodating. on sunday afternoon he was having people over for a spanish barbecue, which we went to for a little bit before venturing out into the city. the small amount of food that i had was delicious, and his friends were very nice as well. joel has a lot of interesting and vintage items in his home which makes it very charming. my boyfriend and i stayed in the bed, which was very comfortable, and another couple slept on the pull out couch, which they said was good but a bit stiff - but fine for the length of our stay. joel left towels, toiletries, etc. for us, which was very nice and convenient. there is also a full kitchen, which we didn't use, but would have been good to have for a longer trip. the pinball machine is awesome as well, as well as the old tube which you can hook your ipod up to."
722114,4510641,2013-05-09,3552871,Daniel,"my stay at the apartment of joel could not have been better. my flight arrived late and even then he sent me sms and made a phone call to see if i had arrived safely.

the place is very good - it has everything you need for a long stay. a full kitchen, bathroom spotless, a very comfortable bed. not to mention the pinball machine;)

one thing caught my attention: the details. from first aid supplies (yes, you will create blisters after walking the national mall integer) to the various types of coffee and tea that joel leave home. he does everything to make you feel the best way possible.

the subway is very close and a fairly quiet street. consider this when deciding quite come to dc!"
722114,4661992,2013-05-19,5220860,Mike,"both joel and his place were awesome! the apartment was spacious, clean, really comfortable, and filled with everything you could want, and joel was super friendly, eager to help, and made sure i had anything i needed  whenever i needed it. he doesn't know it yet, but i'll probably be booking a room with him again when i head back this summer!"
722114,4779084,2013-05-25,5493509,Pamela,"we were very happy with our accommodation at joel's. it was clean, spacious and comfortable. joel was very hospitable and helpful.  he provided many extras such as herbs and spices, washing powder, laptop etc. which made our stay so much more enjoyable."
722114,4960602,2013-06-04,1873677,Jill,"had a very good stay with joel and shannon.  cool downstairs apartment, decor unique and fun!  he thinks of things that can make a big difference like an area map, umbrella, a few games, iron.  great location.  you definately know you are in a regular neighborhood here.  full kitchen amenities except a microwave.  comfortable.  may be a bit hot this summer until the air conditioner gets back on line, but i would recommend a stay here.  a few steep stairs need to be managed, that is the way the homes are here.  laundry hit and miss for availability,  but two very good units.   something else very appreciated was getting an answer and acceptance early for a time frame others were having trouble with.  we had an excellent week.  "
722114,5011585,2013-06-07,2755474,Colin,"joel was very helpful with her suggestions and encouraged us to be more adventurous. we took his recommendations and ventured around d.c and found great eatery.

722114,5248483,2013-06-20,1142354,Lin & Silvia,joel's basement is full of fun. we love our stay there (although i would think this place is best for no more than two people). we didn't really meet joel but his girlfriend was also super accommodating. we will consider stay in joel's place next time we are in town.
722114,5283931,2013-06-22,6879036,Joann,"joel was a great host!  he was very flexible with check in and out times (dmv traffic is awful!).  he was very accomodating and made our stay very comfortable.  the place is cozy and very fun (a photo op may or may not have happened with all the cool decorations and pin ball machine!)  and if you're a dog lover, please make sure you meet oliver.  he's the coolest.  i highly recommend joel's place if you're looking for a great location near hip night life, cool digs, and fun environment!"
722114,5416974,2013-06-29,6663306,Karen,"i arranged for my husband and daughters to stay with joel for a getaway week. they had a blast!  my husband says joel is a ""jack of all trades.""  joel offered very helpful advise on places to visit. his home is very close to the metro, cafes and shopping. they highly recommend joel as a host place!"
722114,5467528,2013-07-01,3485627,Adam,"what a fantastic place to stay. the apartment was amazing, with tons of things to keep me entertained (including a pinball machine). 
the apartment has anything you would ever need, even the bathroom is stocked with toiletries in case you forget something.

joel was so accommodating, and easy to communicate with. he even provided us with a crate for our dog that we brought with us. we loved this place so much and can't wait to stay there again next time we are in dc!"
722114,5573274,2013-07-06,7246506,Mateo,"joel is an awesome host! he was having a 4th of july party, and made my girlfriend and i feel super welcome (we definitely drank a few beers with joel and his awesome friends). he has a lot of cool stuff around the house/ property, and he's extremely helpful! he also gave us great recommendations about places to see in dc, and the best ways to get there. 

in regards to the the apartment that we stayed in--it was fantastic! it's loaded with a ton of cool stuff (i.e. pinball machine, apple airplay, amazing lighting, etc.), and has an amazing vibe to it. will definitely be looking to stay there whenever i head back to dc. "
722114,5812258,2013-07-17,1658516,Nacho,"joel received me and my family with a smile, everything was great and himself made more than necessary to make as feel comfortable in his trendy apt.
thank you again joel!"
722114,5995546,2013-07-25,1176077,Garrett,"highly recommended and i would stay here again.  joel has airbnb down to a science.  from the well stocked toiletries (mouthwash, toothpaste, tissue paper, towels), to the interesting decor, a pinball machine, and a iphone friendly wireless stereo system.  what more could you want or need?  the location near the columbia heights metro station is super convenient for getting to and from regan airport (dca)."
722114,6253951,2013-08-05,6458516,David,joel was awesome! he was very welcoming and eager to tell us about d.c. and the columbia heights neighborhood specifically. we had a great time staying at his one-of-a-kind place.
722114,6349089,2013-08-09,7394633,Solange,we were one lucky family to find joel's apartment. joel is incredibly friendly and helpful a host. the apartment was great for us (a family with 2 children) as there was plenty to entertain all of us. we had a fab time in washington.
722114,6538409,2013-08-16,7149661,Cristian,"awsome! joel help us with parking, luggages and even an welcome beer! place is great , my kids enjoy the pinball! clean and close to metro station! thank you! would be great all hosts to be like joel!
"
722114,6873210,2013-08-28,6668599,Philipp,"at first i booked 1 month too early but joel let us book again immediatly for the correct date (i had to pay twice but that's ok, that was my mistake).
then we had an accident and a delay but joel waited for us and was cool with it. he was always accessible and very friendly.
the apartment is great! it looks exactly like on the photos and it is charming. the location is good. 
we were 5 people. 2 slept in the bed, 2 on the couch and 1 on an air mattress. 
the apartment is downstairs, joel lives upstairs.
joel has 2 dogs (pittbulls i think). i'm not a dog person but i knew he had dogs. if you are afraid of dogs it's maybe not the right place to be because it could be that they are suddenly in your room. anyway they were friendly and i'm still allive ;-)  
if you love dogs you will have fun.
joel was always helpful and good for a talk. 
he showed us the rest of the house which is also very cool arranged. 
all in all, i can recommend the apartment! i would come here again! joel is a great host!"
722114,7639714,2013-09-28,4514370,Terry,"this is a very funky apartment, and joel is a very affable host. my first air bnb experience and i was very happy with it. columbia heights is a good location once you understand the washington metro. an all in one apartment with cooking, laundry etc. and a pinball machine (!), as well as excellent wireless broadband and cable tv. "
722114,7787835,2013-10-03,3820151,Danielle,"joel was a great host!  my boyfriend and i thoroughly enjoyed staying in his columbia heights apartment during our vacation in dc.  joel was incredibly friendly and gave us lots of suggestions of things to do, especially while there was a federal government shutdown.  despite the shutdown, we had an incredible time at joel's place.  the location is amazing -- super close to the metro, only a few blocks from 11th st. restaurants and bars as well as 14th st. eateries in the other direction.  the apartment was entertaining in and of itself with pinball, tv, drum set & his super sweet puppy dogs.  the aesthetic of joel's apartment is very interesting and pleasing, vintage and funky.  it made our stay that much better to be in a place that was well thought-out and cared for.  we would definitely return in the future and recommend joel and shannon's place to everyone!"
722114,7946978,2013-10-09,7493361,Phil,"this was a great place to stay and joel was an exceptional host. even though we had come to washington during the government shutdown, joel helped see to it that there was plenty for us to do. he quickly conjured up a list of attractions and places that were still available for us to visit. the apartment is great and very well located just a fifteen minute walk from all the great restaurants that you can find along 14th from u street, south. 

lots of amenities were available in the flat and when he found out i was a bass player, he quickly brought down a bass and a small amp to play through. that, my friends, is pretty darn good hosting.

my wife and i would happily stay with joel again.
 "
722114,7968528,2013-10-10,8829304,Yu,"joey's apartment is quite good!!! there's even a talking machine in his room. it's easy to check in and check out, just call him and he will be right there in a minute. haha. "

722114,8383734,2013-10-28,9079095,Twanda,joel was very accommodating & attentive.  we enjoyed playing the drum set & the pinball machine.
722114,8427763,2013-10-30,2872876,Kate,"we loved staying at joel's place! it was funky and comfortable and we spent way too much time trying to conquer the pinball machine. joel made sure we had everything we needed, including warm towels and tea and coffee. it was in a neighborhood i'd never spent any time in before on previous visits, so i was super stoked to get to know columbia heights, which is a quick metro ride to the mall. totally recommended. in fact, my boyfriend wants to go back to dc just to stay at this apartment again! "
722114,8511586,2013-11-03,8859188,Joseph,"joel was an excellent host. he was great with communication, helped me find worry free parking, and immediately made us feel at home. his place was very nice - better than the pictures! very comfortable for our group of guys. i wouldn't hesitate to stay at joel's again."

722114,8699212,2013-11-12,1189411,Ian,"great place!  really enjoyed the neighborhood feel, but appreciated both the bus and metro lines being very close by.  lots of nice streets and dog parks to take our dog.  joel's space is very thoughtfully appointed and exactly as the pictures show.  could not recommend it more.  clean, comfortable, and cozy."
722114,9076722,2013-12-04,10323797,Shelby,"first off, the place was awesome! perhaps a little chilly in the winter, but we just blocked the crack under the door and cranked the heater up. joel was super nice and very accommodating - even got us a turntable to hook up to the hifi so we could play records we brought. the decor was super cool - i especially enjoyed having a pinball machine at my disposal. so badass. all in all, we had a wonderful time. it was perfect for our short stay, and it would have been great for a little longer, too. kitchen was perfect, shower had great water pressure and temp. any little toiletry we could have needed was provided. i'd definitely stay here again."
722114,9485629,2013-12-30,1630392,Mark,"this place was awesome!!! it was clean and quite and very close to downtown dc. also, almost every chance i got i played that pinball machine. so much fun! my wife and i will be back."
748316,2880732,2012-11-13,4048381,Sam,"we loved staying at the ""cozy cabin in the city."" the place lives up to it's name! i was very clean, private, cozy, and had everything we needed.

you can jump on the bus and be downtown in 10, walk to the metro (~20min) or rent bikes up on h street. the area has a-lot of great up-and-coming bars, restaurants, late night pizza and a pie shop to boot! (with the best cherry pie elena has tasted).

nicole and ken were very helpful and accommodating, easy to get in touch with and found ways to help us out even when they were out of town"
748316,2972837,2012-11-26,4141008,Christophe,"we had a wonderful stay at the cottage of ken and nicole. the place is brand new, and very clean and comfortable. the location is also very nice, with the capitol just fifteen minutes by foot and a bike and share station around the corner. ken and nicole were very friendly and could help us with all of our questions. the first day, there was a problem with warm water, but they let us take a shower in their house and fixed the problem rightaway. i would definitely recommend this cozy cabin! "
748316,3097007,2012-12-16,4169410,Chris,"ken and nicole have a wonderful little shangri la tucked into the middle of a beautiful capitol hill historic neighborhood.  the cabin has everything one needs for one or two people to be very comfortable and self sufficient during a stay in dc.  the space is cozy, private and well equipped, including lots of helpful information on washington.  i'd highly recommend this place, and ken and nicole as hosts!"
748316,3192304,2012-12-30,4078128,Maria,a fantastic place to stay. very new and clean. definitely i would repeat!
748316,3306115,2013-01-07,4512966,Domenique,"ken and nicole were great hosts and the perfect neighbors for the weekend.  their cabin is just the right size - cozy and comfortable - with the perfect amenities for a stay in the city.  we met them our first night in, and ended up chatting for nearly an hour about the city, architecture, art, and all the local happenings.  they were able to guide us through the capitol hill district from h street all the way down to the eastern market.  inside the cabin there's just enough space to feel at home, but its small enough to remind you that you’re in a city and should probably get out for some fun.  the kitchen is more than adequate, and when we wanted to cook breakfast but couldn't find a pan, nicole grabbed one and brought it out.  the small bathroom is comfortable and the water stayed nice and toasty even after a few showers.  the heater in the room also warms the space quite quickly, so we could turn it off for the day to conserve some energy and fire it up upon our return in the evenings.  great lighting and good colors in the space [did i mention the green shower?] left us happy and content when lounging inside.  and outside, the private gate and doorway let us come and go as we pleased.  a city bikeshare station is right behind the house as well and made for quick and easy getaways to the mall.  we couldn't have asked for a better stay, and love when we can venture to a new city and still feel like we're home.  hopefully we’ll get the chance to visit the cabin in the city again."
748316,3329278,2013-01-11,236738,Megan,"i highly recommend this host! the cabin is clean, neat, and cozy, and has everything you need - plenty of heat, hot water, big and comfy bed, towels, and basic kitchen. there were even a few beers in the fridge when i arrived! it's tastefully furnished and has a roku box with netflix and more. i didn't need a key to enter the cabin, just a code that ken and nicole had set up for me before i arrived. all the information i needed (wifi password, how to use the roku, metro maps, neighborhood info, and more) was neatly laid out in a folder on the bed when i arrived. simple and easy check-in, which i really appreciate!

ken and nicole even got me a parking pass for my rental car! it was easy to park in their neighborhood, which made my commute out to the suburbs in the early morning a breeze. 

the neighborhood feels safe and h street is just a few blocks away. there is plenty of great food and things to do. also, their cat is adorable and spent a couple hours in the cabin with me. we took a nap together. i will look to stay with this host again soon!"
748316,3348015,2013-01-14,1325601,Nathan,"this is a very nice little cottage, perfect for a short visit where you will be spending most of the time in the city.  it has all of the necessary amenities with only the minimum amount of space needed for affordable comfort.  the privacy of the separate entrance from the main house is nice, and it is convenient to a number of interesting bars and restaurants on h street.  the hosts were out of town traveling over the weekend so my girlfriend and i never met them but they were helpful with detailed emails and a courtesy call to make sure we got in ok."
748316,3421886,2013-01-27,1342962,Belinda,"this is a lovely place to stay! you can tell that the owners designed this space as if they were going to be staying there themselves. it is welcoming and beautiful. 
i hope to stay there again when my work takes me back to washington."
748316,3462326,2013-02-02,2044448,Marielena,"ken & nicole's place is a wonderful alternative to a hotel.  it's a nicely designed ""shack"" with a small kitchen and bathroom.  functional and stylish.  nicole was especially helpful and responsive. they have  great binder with all the questions & answers you need. very organized."
748316,3478294,2013-02-04,4814706,Tim,"the place was perfect for a few days in capitol hill.  nicole was friendly, accommodating and willing to allow our dog to stay as well.  the cabin was clean and quite comfortable.  i look forward to returning next time i am in dc, couldn't have asked for anything more."
748316,3536426,2013-02-13,2863046,Catherine,"a great spot close to lots of restaurants and easy access to union station. the cabin was perfect for our stay. it is in a lovely neighbourhood close to parks and eastern market. easy check in and check out, secure and private. thanks"
748316,3562361,2013-02-17,814057,Linda,"i had a great stay at nicole and ken's guest house in washington, dc! nicole was a great help, sending reminder emails with directions and information on how to get in with the numbered lock. the neighborhood was great -- full of families and dogs but also within walking distance to both h street and eastern market/barracks row. the bikeshare station was also right there -- i wasn't able to use it this time but hope to next time i'm in town. the guest house was such a great place to stay for my business trip. there were great instructions on how to use the heater/tv and small helpful things like tea bags, umbrellas, and hangers. it was also nice to have a personal space but also know that if anything had happened i would've just needed to walk up to the back door. highly recommend staying here and i myself hope to be back!"
748316,3653553,2013-02-28,2054724,Jenny,"this little cabin was perfect. a friend who lives in capitol hill saw it and says she'll definitely encourage her guests to stay here. nicole was a very gracious host and really went above and beyond to help us with internet problems. we loved the space, the decor, and the generosity of the hosts. we will definitely stay here again, should the need arise!"
748316,3674024,2013-03-02,425655,Daniel,ken was a fantastic host!  the room was immaculate and i was able to check in late at night.  there were even two beers in the mini fridge to greet me :).  internet was fast too.  thanks ken!
748316,3722370,2013-03-08,1914543,Maggie,"bright and private.  this little building is in the backyard of a home in a great neighborhood. i enjoyed all modes of getting around from there to the hill, especially the capital bike share."
748316,3792898,2013-03-15,5370337,Evelyn,"the cabin felt like a beach retreat.  everything was spotless and well-organized, and nicole and ken couldn't have been more accomodating to me and my daughter.  there's a taxi rank at union station if you don't have a car, and have heavy bags.  otherwise, it's a pleasant walk to their house.  highly recommended!"
748316,3843669,2013-03-20,2307504,Carol,our daughter lives near the cabin so the location is fantastic for us. it is a walking neighborhood near the eastern market with lots of interesting coffee shops and restaurants. the cabin is very quiet and perfectly appointed. it makes a wonderful retreat from the city that surrounds it.
748316,3889506,2013-03-25,4170483,Anna,"ken and nicole were great hosts. they were prompt with communication and everything was organized to the t. the cabin was adorable and exactly as pictured. they even had travel books, maps, and brochures readily available. loved all the attention to detail in the kitchen and even beer in the fridge! the bike share is only steps away and that was a cheap, quick, and easy way to navigate around the city. i'd highly recommend staying with ken and nicole if you're planning on coming to dc! "
748316,3935885,2013-03-29,3657666,Mart,"the cabin was perfect! we had everything we needed, could not loose a key because of the great key code system and didn't have to bother anyone to come or go. thanks ken and nicole for the tea time stories and the good reading tips :). "
748316,3997625,2013-04-02,4882740,Ralph,"this was my first experience using airbnb and it was important because it was also the first time my wife would be visiting washington. the cozy cabin turned out to be perfect. quiet, self-contained, safe, it was easy to make our special diet breakfasts and then walk over to the eastern market for coffee and from there make our way anywhere in just a few minutes either by walking to the capital, flagging a taxi or grabbing a bus. while sirens seem constant in the city core, the cabin is in a very quiet neighbourhood.  the best recommendation i can give it is to say the next time we're in washington, we're staying at the cozy cabin. loved it...!!"
748316,4045629,2013-04-05,2901867,Michael,"we just spent 3 night in the cosy cabin and it was a very pleasant experience. the location was great, we even walked to the capital area one day.  the cabin is well equipped, quiet, stylish and very clean.  there was lots of useful information about washington and where to eat in the area. i think this was a real find."
748316,4092172,2013-04-09,4527760,Frederic,très bon accueil. nicole et ken sont des hôtes très agréables et soucieux du confort de leur visiteurs. la cabine est flambant neuve et est très pratique pour 2 personnes ! nous recommandons !!!
748316,4142901,2013-04-13,1097118,Lauren,"a great place to stay! very comfortable cabin in a nice area. i appreciated that the owners provided basic breakfast items including coffee (though i didn't use them) near a bike share station. a pleasant, 15 minute walk to the library of congress."
748316,4181682,2013-04-16,1878358,Karl,"great little cabin. clean, very hot water, very good location. ken and nicole were helpful leading up to our trip. and the convenience of the bike share was a revelation. the best way to get around dc!"
748316,4211005,2013-04-19,3248957,Jillian,"i visited dc for three nights in april and was very pleased with my stay at this cozy cabin! the accommodations were clean, well-stocked, and extremely convenient. after a quick walk from union station, i found the cabin easily and in a nice neighborhood. it is within walking area to h street with delicious restaurants (check out toki underground!) and a nice stroll to the capitol and other dc sites. the hosts were very clear in their instructions, generous in their recommendations, and pleasant upon meeting. i would definitely recommend this place to any visitor to dc!"
748316,4279835,2013-04-24,4900532,Justine,"great little spot in capitol hill. not as central, location-wise, but perfect if you're a cyclist. the capital bikeshare program is right outside. nicole is very nice and helpful and the space is very clean. perfect for two. thanks! "
748316,4310096,2013-04-27,5088711,Marjorie,"this cozy self contained home is in a very good location near both the amtrak station and a great little community (eastern market). everything was clean and well organized and we enjoyed our privacy coming and going as we pleased. we would not hesitate to recommend this lovely, well priced home."
748316,4389387,2013-05-02,5008409,Erik,"this was the perfect location for my wife and i to stay on our trip to dc. conveniently located and quietly comfortable, i would stay here again. ken and nicole were very nice and offerred us advice that definitely made the trip more enjoyable. i highly recommend the cozy cabin."
748316,4591413,2013-05-14,3504225,Jillian,"our stay in the cozy cabin was delightful!  ken and nicole were extremely kind and welcoming.  the cabin was exactly like the photos and it was well stocked with just the right things.  it offered just the right amount of privacy but we still felt welcome to knock on their back door for any reason at all.  very close to the bus stop and not a far walk to union station on a pretty day.  h street offered excellent pizza and an intimate coffee shop.
their two daughters were adorable and entertaining as well as their sweet dog and cat.  the cat even visited us one morning in our room!  we loved him!   on our last day, nicole offered a car ride back to the train station.  how kind!
i would highly recommend staying in the cozy cabin during your stay in washington, d.c. 
thank so much ken and nicole! we appreciate kind hosts like you!"
748316,4658162,2013-05-19,73202,Michael,"ken and nicole are marvelous hosts. they do all they can to make your stay a pleasure. their cabin or guest house is cozy, as it's one room with a separate bath. it's clean and efficient in a quiet neighborhood with nice neighbors. and the 3-4 blocks away h section is a fun place for meals and a drink or three.

if you wish to tour dc sites, you can bike in (although imo dc is not a touring bikers' town) or take a taxi, which we did (or you can do the bus i guess). at the moguls' rental rate, dc is very affordable.

slight cons: the wireless tv setup is 98% great and 2% weak signal. perhaps a signal booster would help. not a fault, but the sitting arrangement is two counter stools, where you also may dine or drink. a family of three would be crowded. the only place to set down luggage is the floor; perhaps a portable stand would help.

overall, we'd stay again because of the cleanliness, quiet neighborhood, genteel owners and price. dc is a glorious, noisy, busy city and the cozy cabin proved to be the respite we needed."
748316,4754587,2013-05-24,3196060,Mélanie,"cabine très authentique au fond du jardin de l'hôte. correspond avec précision aux photos et aux descriptions. appartement très propre. l'hôte est une personne très agréable et disponible: en effet, dans notre cas un soucis de canalisations nous a empêché d'utiliser la douche et les toilettes mais nous avons été prévenu 4 jours avant notre arrivée nous permettant de trouver une solution pratique et financière avec l'hôte. nous recommandons pleinement ce logement!!!"
748316,4799043,2013-05-27,4755283,Jill,"the cozy cabin was perfect for two people. the cabin has everything you could need or want. the location was great and easy to find. with the help of nicole's binder we were able to make our way around the city very easily. the cabin is detached from the house making it simple to come and go. i highly recommend staying here, location is great, cabin is perfect, and the host are informative and very nice as well. "
748316,4857392,2013-05-29,3417897,Cathy,"my first stay with airbnb and we had a great time. the cabin is clean, neat and furnished with everything down to milk for the cereal. loved this cozy cabin. this is an even better opportunity for younger folks who like to cycle; there is a dc bike station about 1/2 a block away. excellent experience.
"
748316,4916122,2013-06-02,1577678,Sarah,"this  was my second stay with ken & nicole, but first time staying in the cabin, which i really enjoyed, a very pleasant private space with the comfort of not feeling too isolated. everything one needs is there, and since it was so hot in washington, i came back earlier and spent more time than i normally would in the room. good shower, efficient ac, good wifi, netflix.  15-20 mins  pretty walk from town, eastern mkt etc. very good communication with nicole, and the whole experience easy and delightful. thank you."
748316,5004612,2013-06-07,4904554,David,"el estudio está totalmente equipado y todo muy nuevo, hay un parque en la puerta. puedes alquilar las bicis de dc o coger el autobus muy cerca, o andar hasta union station o capitol en 15 minutos.
nicole fue muy atenta en todo momento, nos consiguió el permiso para aparcar el coche de alquiler en la calle cuando llegamos.
asi que recomendamos el estudio de  ken y nicole sin ninguna duda."
748316,5076307,2013-06-11,3479783,Betty,"tanto ken como nicole son unos anfitriones excepcionales! la comunicación entre ellos la califico con un 10!!! responden al momento cualquier mail.
la cabaña es perfecta, todo muy limpio y con todo tipo de detalles: utensilios para cocinar, desayunar, café, azúcar.... hasta palomitas! te dejan mapas y planos, todo muy detallado para llegar a cualquier punto de washington.
realmente la tienen con mucho gusto y cariño. se nota que a nicole le gusta el color turquesa, jejej. además habla y entiende bastante español, así que para posibles futuros viajeros... tenerlo en cuenta.
zona muy tranquila y segura, a 20 mins. andando del capitolio.
si vuelvo algún día (seguro que sí ya que me encantó) no dudaría ni un solo momento en volver a quedarme con ellos.

gracias ken y nicole por vuestra confianza, hospitalidad y hacernos sentir a gusto."
748316,5127956,2013-06-14,5878135,Edwin,"nicole and ken were great hosts. the description was very accurate. nicole suggestion to rent bikes were great, it is very easy to go from her home to the capitol by bicycle. she helped us to understand the city and helped us to arrange a shuttle to the airport. i recommend and would return on a new trip to washington."
748316,5204007,2013-06-18,2198070,Caroline,"great hosts, great spot. we got into dulles and nicole had advised us to book the supershuttle so just $40.00 to get to ne sector and dropped off at the door. the cabin is small but very lovely and very well equipped - we especially valued the netflix when we had roamed around dc and just wanted to flake out. the location is great 20minutes steady walk to eastern market ( saturday market is great) and a little less to union station (check out the postal museum just across the way). we bought the $10.00 smart metro ticket which was great for buses too. just a few blocks from nicole and ken is h street, they had left good directions to the food places and we had a really nice meal at cusbah on our first night in dc.  we had a lovely time all round."
748316,5247860,2013-06-20,6423773,Meg,"i loved this place!  it was tiny but perfectly designed with every possible thing you'd need for a stay.  i unfortunately didn't get to meet the hosts personally but they sent me great, helpful information on directions, found bikeshare locations near the conference i was attending and coming in and out was easy and they were very reachable with the one problem i had with the door lock.  they provided great info on the neighborhood, and the neighborhood was beautiful, walkable and diverse with great restaurant and bars nearby.  thanks again!"
748316,5272212,2013-06-22,5298318,Amandine,"we had a very good stay. the room is situated well, clean and well equipped. ken mogul give good advice to visit the city.
"
748316,5394653,2013-06-28,5991788,Nicole,"our stay in this cabin was our first experience with airbnb and it couldn't have gone better. prior to our stay, communication with nicole and ken was easy and they responded quickly to all inquiries. the cabin is so charming, in a great location and super clean! the hosts provided everything we could have possibly needed for our short stay, including a parking permit. we definitely highly recommend this cabin to everyone and hope to stay here next time we're in dc."
748316,5442489,2013-06-30,6977036,Steve,had a great time in dc and the cozy cabin was perfect. communication was great with ken. 
748316,5451398,2013-07-01,5229581,Bernadette,ken was great too. we had everything we needed and also very helpful on where to go and what to do. wouldn't have known about bike share without him!! plus we loved the little cabin. what a fantastic idea!
748316,5556504,2013-07-06,4392462,Carmen,"the cozy cabin was awesome! it was perfect for my boyfriend and i to share for our five day visit - it had everything we needed and we had a great time! the keycode entry system is awesome because we didn't have to worry about coordinating when we arrived or worry about losing the keys and inconveniencing anyone, but we happened to run into ken anyway and got to say hi! he's really nice!

we used the super convenient bikeshare to get to the metro every day - it's a short bike ride through comfortable streets with very few cars...until you enter downtown. we only did that once and then decided to stick with the metro."
748316,5608874,2013-07-08,6660811,Brad,"the cabin was cozy clean and cool.  it was just the right size for my wife and me on a beautiful sunny july weekend. the neighborhoid id very cool.  the mall is about a mile, and its a pleasant walk.  it did occur yo me thst if we'd been rainbound it would have been too small.  ken is great-very hospitible, very gracious, very welcoming.  i go to dc for business and i would stay here again."
748316,5717485,2013-07-13,6281230,Andrew,"ken was a good host and spent time sharing his knowledge and orientating us to the area.  the cabin was quite, compact and very comfortable with all of the  conveniences we had anticipated.  it was very close to the mall which made the main sights very accessable and it was also within a short walking distance to a number of dining options for dinner. we taxied to and from the cabin to union station for the sake of convenience and fares were about $10 each way.  we also used the city bike share program and a nearby bike rack was only 50 metres from the cabin."
748316,5756313,2013-07-15,6552740,Olivia,"the cozy cabin was fantastic and exactly as ken had described it online. we were pleased with the privacy and cleanliness. the neighborhood was quiet and safe. the only slight issue we had was with the location -- it was a 20 minute walk to the nearest metro, something ken clearly stated in his description, but which proved to be a bit of a hassle in the july heat. hailing a taxi in the area is also nearly impossible. we truly enjoyed our stay at the cozy cabin, but it would probably be better for those who plan to rent a car. "
748316,5827292,2013-07-18,6695072,Kendall,"my boyfriend and i recently stayed at the cabin for three nights during our east coast adventure! the cabin had everything we could've wanted and more. ken was there to greet us and show us the ropes of the place as well as explain the public transport, bike system and map of the area. we found that we felt extremely comfortable, almost right at home. ken and nicole accommodated and had what ever one would need already at the cabin. 
we found it was very easy to drive and find street parking all throughout downtown dc. it was about a 10 minute drive and everything was in walking distance.
although we were unable to personally meet nicole, we did exchange through email and she was gracious enough to make sure we had everything we need in preparation to our trip. i would highly recommend staying here if you're ever in dc!
thank you again. "
748316,5907935,2013-07-22,4328092,Jody,"we had a fantastic time at ken and nicole's cozy cabin. it perfectly suited our needs for being tourists in d.c. we made use of the capitol bikeshare, and a station is just a block away--great way to get to all the main sites on the mall. we went to the cusbah restaurant on h st. a couple of times because we enjoyed it so much our first night there. the cabin is wonderful--we ate all our breakfasts there, and though it was in the upper 90s while we were there, the cabin stayed cool and sleeping was very comfortable (great bed, too). ken and nicole were very responsive via email and also while we were there. we would love to go back to d.c. and stay there again."
748316,5999393,2013-07-26,5295294,Amy,we enjoyed our stay at the cozy cabin which provided all our needs. it was clean and convenient. it was a bonus that it was relatively new construction. friendly owners. quiet. nice residential neighborhood near bike share location. the availability of free parking on the neighborhood streets was great. 
748316,6213697,2013-08-04,5726849,Halina Veronica,"the amount of information given to us by nicole and`ken both before we arrived and during our stay was very extensive and thoughtful.  nicole was always willing to give further advice and info
when we needed it and these aspects are so important to an airbnb-er. also her book selection in the cozycabin was fabulous, if
only we had had time to read as well as visit this lovely city! also being able to walk through lovely streets to the station and so on made it a good location."
748316,6504940,2013-08-15,3867684,Dave,"the cabin is everything it 'said on the tin' clean, comfy with everything we needed. a very easy 15 minute walk into the centre of the city, perfect! ken and nicole responded almost instantly every time we communicated and nothing was too much trouble. thank you."

748316,7271216,2013-09-14,1771335,Gina,"oh definitely one of our favourite airbnb experiences! we had a ball in dc and this place is an absolute must. we found the local spots on h street (recommend the pug & the queen vic!) & had a few amazing nights out. ken and nicole were just brilliant, communication was constant and the cabin exceeded expectations. we also knocked in and met ken he was very welcoming. the city bike scheme is literally a stones throw away with union station a 10 min taxi or a quick cycle away (it was too hot for us to walk!!) loved it!! thanks ken & nicole we'd love to return!"
748316,7389644,2013-09-18,827214,Kyle,"great location and a really cool place!  public transportation and biking are friendly in the neighborhood.  thanks for the accommodations, we'll look to book again on our return visit to dc."

it is easy to get into the city center, however, you should make yourself familiar with the dc bike sharing since the next station is just around the corner.
we enjoyed our stay very much and would highly recommend this cabin!"

748316,8234663,2013-10-21,9326946,Amy,"lovely weekend stay.  it was quiet, warm, and cozy.  we stayed in late october and found the temperature inside to be fine without even using the hvac.  we had no problems with street parking and took advantage of the nearby capital bike share system to get to and from the metro.  owners were responsive to questions and throughout the booking and our stay, while giving us our privacy.  they prepared a booklet with lots of helpful information on the area and provided instructions for troubleshooting anything that might malfunction. we would definitely stay here again."

748316,8354784,2013-10-27,289802,Christina,"a stylish little efficiency on the edge of the capitol hill neighborhood. it's tiny but mighty, with everything you need and some perks (like netflix!) the neighborhood has easy parking and there is a bike share a block away, you are a 10 minute ride to all the sights of dc. i was there for a little work and a little fun and our accommodations helped us accomplish both! the hosts were very communicative and its was an easy, no fuss in and out."

pick up  service,  but no problems getting back home at the
end of the day. i definitely recommend their cozy cabin!  harriet"
748316,8749686,2013-11-16,4002428,Shaun & Hailey,the cosy cabin was perfect with everything we needed for our short stay in washington and would certainly recommend anyone who is going to washington to stay here. 
748316,8831930,2013-11-20,3786493,Tim,"we didn't have much time in washington dc, but this cabin was more than we could have asked or hoped for. ken and nicole were great hosts, allowing us to go our own way, but also extremely welcoming when we did have time for a chat. the cabin is even bigger than it seems on the pictures, with lots of space, a great bed, clean bathroom, and lots of privacy, and it was great to be able to relax with some of our favourite shows on netflix when we got home late at night. the bike share station right behind their house is a massive plus, and it made it really simple for us to move around the city. this is the only way to cover as much ground, as comfortably as possible, and we wouldn't reccomend doing it anyother way. they also have a binder in the cabin, with all the info you could ask for about their neighbourhood and the city ittself. the suggestions for places to eat and things to do were spot on. making use of the bike share program really allowed us the oppurtunity to really get a feel for dc. communication was quick and effective, and ken's suggestion to make use of uber to get a cab also worked out perfectly. our only negative experience of washington was the cab driver that picked us up from union station when we arrived in dc, but ken and nicole and their awesome little backyard cabin made up for it completely!"
748316,8855350,2013-11-22,8781689,Devon,100% as advertised.  supper accommodation close to what i needed.  
748316,9073655,2013-12-04,6033387,Janice,"the cozy cabin is probably the best first airbnb experience i could have had! the place was exactly as pictured and came fully stocked with everything (and more) that i could possibly need for my short visit (amenities included microwave, kettle, fridge, iron & ironing board, blow dryer, towels + extra blankets, wifi, etc.)

it was a short stay and we were both busy, so i only met nicole (host) briefly, but she was very nice and extremely thorough and responsive in our email correspondence (making sure i knew how to get to the place from the airport, answering q's about the city, etc.)

there is no reason not to stay with these great people in the cabin if you find yourself in dc :)"
748316,9127488,2013-12-09,9087149,Elli,"couldn't have been better.  the cottage/cabin/shack is true to the photos, very cozy and bright with all the amenities (netflix, wi-fi, fridge, coffeemaker, etc).  the location is great in a quite, beautiful neighborhood close to h street where there's great food and beer for those who like microbrews.  also, just a 20 minute walk from union station and a 30 minute job to lincoln memorial."
748316,9387720,2013-12-25,10597557,Guy,"we stayed 3 nights in the cabin - and it was great! very clean, looks brand new and cozy indeed!
nicole and ken are very helpful and they arranged us parking permit for the rented car and assisted with everything we needed. 
we would definitely recommend it! thanks a lot!"
748316,9450309,2013-12-29,10476473,Victoria,"we had a great first airbnb experience here! the cabin was exactly as pictured and so cute. what i really loved were all the touches that made this small space work: there were empty shelves by the bed for unpacking items, plenty of towel bar space in the bathroom for wet towels, and frosted windows which let in a ton of natural light, but gave a lot of privacy. i also loved that there was a table fan--great for those used to white noise.

we drove our car and had no problem finding close street parking. the location made it easy to get around the city and over into arlington as well with no problem. definitely a great place to stay!"
763569,5961714,2013-07-24,5487665,Marcio,"hi everybody,
i stayed at natasha's romantic studio for 4 months (from april/2013 until july/2013) and it was really a wonderful time. the studio has everything you need, and it is really charming, comfortable, very well located and natasha is a great landlord and hostess.
she helped me a lot during my staying in dc. my wife, my daughter and my stepson also loved the studio and its location. it allowed us to get to all dc attractions easily and we had many fancy and excellent restaurants nearby. cleveland park is a great place to stay.
the facilities and the building were also great.
if you want to run or walk, there are many parks nearby, there is also the national zoo only 250 m from the building.
i do recommend you to stay at this studio. it is a secure, affordable and wonderful way to be able to enjoy dc. 
tchau, and thank you again natasha.
marcio"
763569,9303155,2013-12-20,935800,Adam,"i stayed at natasha's studio for five months and had a wonderful time. the neighborhood is just great - very safe and convenient with a relaxed atmosphere. it's close to pretty much everything (grocery, pharmacies, cafés, cinema, restaurants, plus the rock creek park) with the metro virtually right outside the door.  the studio is small but nicely decorated and has everything you need. natasha was also a terrific host, very accommodating and quick to reply to all my questions and minor maintenance issues (such as a broken light fixture). i would definitely recommend staying here!"
784186,3654099,2013-02-28,1655660,Daniel,"grace was wonderful -- she was able to accommodate our stay on extremely short notice, helping us out of a jam after some previous plans had fallen through. the apartment was clean, spacious, and well-appointed, and was perfectly located, within easy walking distance to both the adams morgan and columbia heights business districts, as well as the metro. i would gladly stay at grace's apartment again the next time i'm in d.c!"
784186,3736266,2013-03-10,1020219,Diego,"grace's place was gorgeous, very well located in the adams mordan area in dc. my family stayed there for a week and they enjoyed themselves very much. i highly recommend their place."
784186,4489493,2013-05-08,4104564,Summer,what a fantastic apartment!! it is perfectly located for walking or metro and is quite spacious for dc. pheabe was fantastic!! we will definitely be back. 
784186,8088630,2013-10-15,5796406,Katie,"my family and i stayed in pheabe's cute apartment for 3 nights while exploring dc. it was a wonderful stay. pheabe was so accommodating - she met us earlier than usual for check-in, and when we arrived, had the kitchen stocked with waters, juice and coffee for us. the apartment itself was in a great, safe building in a perfect location. it was a fairly short walk to the metro (which we used exclusively to get around in dc), and we found some delicious restaurants down the street (we loved perry's). i would just mention that the street noise below could be a little noisy at night, however we were so exhausted at the end of the day that it didn't bother us too much.

overall, it was a wonderful stay and i would definitely stay here again! thanks, pheabe! 
"
784186,8281167,2013-10-23,2541066,Kimberly,"we stayed in this 2-bedroom apartment for a week, while attending a work conference at the nearby (15 min walk) hilton hotel. the rooms are true to the photographs and we had a good stay. the place is clean and well decorated, and has all the amenities we needed. would happily recommend to others.
"
792578,3782556,2013-03-14,9128362,Ligo,"really nice house as well as the host, leonard. he prepared everything for us in the house. the house is in a very quiet community and only 10-15 minutes away from metro blue line. if you wanna a memorizable trip around d.c., that's should be your first choice for living. "
792578,3985538,2013-04-01,2244708,Brian And Samantha,"leonard's place has everything you will need for a family weekend getaway. firstly, his place is immaculately clean and comfortable. second, it is located close to the metro, supermarket , church and anything else you may need for your stay. thirdly, it is a real bargain for a group of people, especially a family, to stay so close to the city yet still have the feeling like you never left home. i plan to come back and stay there- highly recommended!!!!"
792578,4147498,2013-04-14,5265717,Jim,"the home was exactly as advertised.  it was very roomy and comfortable.  unfortunately, the 1st night i parked directly in front of the apartment, and got a $50 ticket.  that was my fault, it was clearly marked, i simply didn't see the sign.  on the 2nd night, however, someone broke into our rental car and stole various items including a brand new gps. it ruined the trip for us. i hope you have better luck.  leonard was very kind and gracious in all of our interactions."
792578,4698057,2013-05-20,334767,Clara,the reservation was canceled 53 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.
792578,4840471,2013-05-28,4284241,Jarrod,leonard's home was a great find! from the very beginning he was easy to get in contact with and was flexible when working with me. his house is very neat and clean and the price was very reasonable. i really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again.
792578,5296224,2013-06-23,6392910,Kayla,the house is within 15 min of the center of d.c. in car. the house was well-maintained and there was lots of room.  there is no parking but it was easy to park close to the house on the quiet street just be careful of no parking signs. however it is close to a more dangerous neighborhood so it is recommended to arrive by day to the house but we had no problems.  the owner responded quickly to emails and explained everything when we arrived. 
792578,6641785,2013-08-19,8074925,Tina,leonardo place was amazing!!! he  was very hospitable and responded to all questions expeditiously. the home was very clean and had everything we needed and all he asked is to leave it how it was found. two thumbs up
792578,7283599,2013-09-14,6503861,Csaba,"the apartment was absolutely fine! everything is nice, the location is really good, you can go to the union sq. easily by bus without a change. the communication was also good with leonard! a+++!"
792578,7365597,2013-09-17,7688317,Gianrocco,"leonard wasn't in the house and i never met him, but all was really good here. the house is big, in a quite neighborhood near washington (downtown is far only 10 minutes by car). kitchen large and 3 bathrooms very comfortable."
792578,8083221,2013-10-15,5009531,Marie,"la maison de léonard est très spacieuse, très jolie et très bien située, le quartier est propre et agréable.
un grand supermarché et même plusieurs à proximité.
vraiment tout était parfait."
792578,8375131,2013-10-28,2019488,Dorothea Calise,i had a wonderful time at leonard's place. he was quick with responses. the location is more than spacious and leonard was more than helpful. he and some friends even took myself and my guest out to show us around dc. 
792578,8607645,2013-11-07,6442207,Tim,"lots of space, clean and comfortable - quiet neighborhood"
792578,8619388,2013-11-08,9807711,Rebekah,"so easy to stay here. leonard was quick to respond to texts and emails. the house was very large and it was so wonderful having access to internet and the tv, a full house. we loved staying here and would highly recommend it to anyone!"
800076,3739720,2013-03-10,5187889,Maria,"the apartments were very comfortable. very clean, good bathroom, separate entrance. we enjoyed staying there. tricia was very hospitable, she advised us about the weather and shopping, answered to our questions and requests very quickly. the only this is boiler which was a bit noisy but if you sleep well it won't bother you.  and sometimes we were missing a small separate table for dinner. but there is a table with tv where you can eat. overall our staying was great and thanks to tricia for her care and support. if i come back to dc i would stay here again. "
800076,3797960,2013-03-16,1795202,Allie,"this was the perfect little place for my husband and i. quaint, clean, comfortable and its location were all perfect for our stay! the host was wonderful to work with! we enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and dining out at some of the restaurants along 14th street. it was so close to the metro, which made hopping around the city a breeze! glad we decided to stay at too mundo.... we'll definitely be back the next time we're in dc!"
800076,3856650,2013-03-21,1605017,Marty,"too was a perfect host. even though when we booked the place there were no reviews when we booked (she just recently started posting on airbnb) she made us feel incredibly comfortable from day 1. 
the space is private, welcoming and in a great location. less than 100 yards to the metro station and plenty of things to do in the neighborhood - too has great recommendations of where to go.

we are going to be booking her place again in april!  "
800076,3951358,2013-03-30,4131223,Hannah,"we had a fantastic stay in washington at tricia's place. we were 3 people in the appartment (2 adults and 1 child) and felt it spacoius and welcoming. the location is amazing only steps to the metro and in the middle of washington city centre. many restaurants in the area. the appartmernt is lovely, it must have been renovated recently. both the bed and sofa bed are very comfortable. nice to have the small kitchen and own entrance to the appartment via the back yard. the bathroom is spacious and the towels are new and luxurious. tricia is very nice and helpful. a folder with information about the appartment, area and maps is available in the room. 
the heating system is noisy but other than that everything is perfect. we would definately stay at tricia's place again if we come back to washington!"
800076,4046388,2013-04-05,5586404,Katie,"we had a great time staying here and couldn't recommend it more highly. tricia was so helpful and accommodating throughout our entire stay. she was very easy to get ahold of both before we arrived and while we were staying there. the apartment was clean, comfortable, and truly felt like a little home away from home. being so close to the u street metro station made getting around very easy. (get a 7 day short fare pass for sightseeing, it's a great deal!) the neighborhood felt safe and welcoming at all times, day or night. i would certainly stay here again and will recommend it to anyone i know visiting dc. also, make sure to get a bowl of the famous ben's chili from across the street, it made a great late night snack!"
800076,4075914,2013-04-08,203175,Paul,"we would not recommend this host. we were able to show up early and leave our bags, which was nice. however, the room was still not ready upon our arrival later in the day and we had to wait while it was prepared. we then informed the host that we had to wake up very early (4:30 am) on our last day to get to the airport, and asked her if she knew the numbers of any cab companies that could pick us up that early. our host stated she could get that information for us, but never did. we were living below our hosts and could not control the temperature in the unit, so if we were too hot or cold we had to text our host to adjust the thermostat, which was inconvenient. finally, our host and her boyfriend had several friends over on our last night and we were kept up all night with the sounds of people walking upstairs in their shoes, shouting and laughing until after 2 am. we felt this was very disrespectful considering the fact that their guests had a very early flight in the morning. perhaps this was not the best weekend for her to be hosting airbnb guests if she was planning on having a party during our stay. in all, we felt like more of an afterthought in someones basement. we did have a great time in dc and the location of the apartment was great..just choose a different host!"
800076,4127343,2013-04-12,3741850,Tamp,tricia was a gracious host and did a great job of ensuring we had a wonderful stay. i wouldn't hesitate recommending this apartment to a friend.
800076,4175039,2013-04-15,5867201,Avi,"this place is awesome, and tricia is a wonderful, accommodating host.  it's this spacious yet somehow cozy studio with everything you need for a few days of r&r right in the middle of dc's best neighborhoods.  i had a fantastic stay and i hope to come back!"
800076,4259020,2013-04-22,3392521,Brandon,"we had a great time staying here for the weekend. too thought of everything we could have needed and more, even providing a binder with suggestions for restaurants and activities. the space was lovely, the bed was huge, and there was even a secluded outdoor sitting area. great location, great price. highly recommended!"
800076,4398030,2013-05-02,465125,Frank,great place in good location. nice host. 
800076,4492327,2013-05-08,5491770,Megan,tricia was a wonderful host! she was flexible and made us feel welcomed! she invited us to a small cinco de mayo party that was a blast (and the food was delicious!) the neighborhood is excellent and her home is very close to the train. i'm so happy that we stayed here!
800076,4746761,2013-05-23,1266087,Aleksandr,"stayed for four nights at too's place - a great apartment, super convenient to everything, and a wonderfully friendly owner! only [small] problem was cell phone reception - with at&t, it was hard to get a signal in the basement, but the wifi was great, so i never really had an issue with it."
800076,4785676,2013-05-26,3953482,Donna,"i stayed here with my husband and sister and we all loved it! 

the apartment itself feels really spacious, modern and clean and has everything you might need. this includes loads of info and maps on the area which i found really helpful for getting around.

the location is great too only a minute from the metro and loads of shops and restaurants. 

tricia (the host) was also extremely accommodating when it came to checking in and out times which made our stay a lot easier.

i would certainly recommend this place to any couple or group of three. i really cant imagine you could find anything much better for this low price.

 "
800076,4889269,2013-05-31,1531066,Daphne,she was so helpful in a pinch and very thorough in making sure the guests were all set and had every bit of information needed. a great host to work with!
800076,4975004,2013-06-04,4342835,Marie,"i really liked this place overall. the accommodations were comfortable and clean, though this isn't a designer apartment. one of the biggest advantages was a metro stop less than a block away. the host responded very quickly to messages, including queries as mundane as whether the apartment had a hair dryer (answer: no). the parking charge ($35 per day/night) seemed steep at first, but it is actually competitive with what hotels in the area ask. plus, it was very convenient to have our car right there."
800076,5015782,2013-06-07,6705082,Kathy,"great stay in an immaculate basement apartment in a wonderful neighborhood in dc. trisha was most helpful and friendly and the place was very quiet. very convenient to the metro, restaurants and coffee houses. would highly recommend."
800076,5215856,2013-06-18,3586462,Joshua,"the basement garden was great.  very cozy and easy access to the metro and u street.  the space was clean and well kept, and the hostess was very considerate when she sent a number of suggestions for restaurants and entertainment."
800076,5312138,2013-06-24,6041406,Laurel,"it was my first time using airbnb and what a great experience! we were looking for accommodations close to the conference center and this apartment was close to everything, with easy access to the metro, yellow line straight from the airport (reagan). 
our host too mundo made sure we had all the information we needed and getting there and into the apartment was easy. everything was as described and she even left a little treat for us for the first morning. 
we were lucky enough to have beautiful weather and so hung out on the nice patio on several evenings (bring bug spray though!) on a couple of nights our host joined us and we enjoyed getting to know her as well. 
the neighborhood that the apartment is in is very fun, if you like good food, bars and galleries you will enjoy the area. the street the apartment is on is charming and historic and we heard very little sound once inside our cozy apartment. 
so thank you too for being a thoughtful and charming host, we very much enjoyed our stay!"
800076,5401687,2013-06-28,6742938,Lisa,"the location is great. there are restaurants nearby and the subway is just around the corner. the place is clean, spacious and comfy! it was great to have a frig and cooktop. too responded immediately to any questions/concerns we had. we loved using this little place as home base while we explored dc! it was our first airbnb experience and all 3 of us loved it!"
800076,5678721,2013-07-11,6821836,Catalina,nice clean place. close to transport and nice restaurants. we had a great time and recommend this place to others!

800076,5891294,2013-07-21,6911678,Della,"too was fabulous and the space is perfect. the check in was clear, the apartment was clean and exactly as described and pictured. the location is excellent - right next to the metro and tons of restaurants, shopping and night life. there was a small issue with the plumbing but we sent a text message and she was right on top of it. we slept like babies in the super comfy bed. i will happily rent this location again. "
800076,6010183,2013-07-26,7319315,Andrew,"we were very pleased with our experience here. the place was immaculate when we arrived. there were plenty of towels and toiletries for our use in the bathroom. the kitchen had appropriate cookware, utensils, and towels. there were also the little things, like salt and pepper, in addition to oil so that we could easily cook without having to purchase these things. the binder in the room was very helpful, as it listed important information about restaurants and attractions. the bed is huge, and the linens comfortable. our daughter slept on the couch, and there were extra sheets and blankets for her. there was a little library of books and magazines, as well as metro maps that were helpful. the neighborhood itself is convenient to many area attractions, and there are plenty of stores around should you need to pick up food or other essentials. the neighborhood was quiet and felt safe during our stay. this was a great experience for our family of 3, and we would definitely stay here again if we are ever in the area."
800076,6416390,2013-08-12,5233289,Joanna,"a very cosy, clean and quiet room, in a great location. very convenient to the metro, bikeshare, shops and great restaurants. trish was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay."

800076,6705111,2013-08-22,4607353,Miguel,"habitación muy amplia, con cama muy amplia y todo lo necesario para comer( frigorifico, microondas, basos, sartenes, ....) tambien sal, café, azucar,.... todo limpio y con todo lo necesario para el aseo, toallas, jabones, champu. la zona con tiendas, cafeterias, metro, bicicletas. por poner una critica negativa que la entrada la tienes por la parte de atras, por un callejón.
creo que es un gran sitio, comparado a un hotel de 4 estrellas.
si vuelvo volveré a este sitio."

801699,7157951,2013-09-09,7067760,Richard,"my stay at karen's apartment was perfect. the loft is immaculate, spacious and located in a very convenient neighborhood. the decor and furniture is also very modern and well curated. it is also furnished with all the amenities that you'll need during your stay. i requested for an indoor parking space during my stay of a several months and karen immediately arranged everything for me. she is a great host, very easy to communicate with and always willing to offer help. i will definitely stay there if i ever visit the capitol again."
801699,8853638,2013-11-21,10107993,Brendan,"perfect apartment. perfect host. this apartment is immaculate, huge, quiet, and in a great location. the building’s continuously monitored front desk and double door entry requiring key fob make it feel very secure and comfortable. dc is a very walkable city and this place puts you in reach of it all. the owner is off-site but was wonderfully responsive via emails and text and was helpful with everything from restaurant recommendations to parking spots. with a wine bar and a pizza place across the street, a high end korean place and a sushi place around the corner, and chinatown and verizon center just a few blocks away, there is tons to do. i i’ve stayed in a lot of places in dc and the giant kitchen and private bedroom (despite floor to ceiling windows!) make this one a gem. "
808830,3379311,2013-01-20,3829566,Darren,"being the first guest at max & jane's beautiful home was a delight. i was treated like family & even bella the family dog was always waiting to greet me at the door upon my return from work each night. jane's home is very spacious, warm, very comfortable and most of all inviting. it truly was a home away from home. the house is very convenient to public transport, a whole foods market and many other good restaurants. max and jane were friendly hosts who were happy to go the extra mile to make sure all my needs were met. the guest bedroom is very large, with it's own private bathroom and the bed is very comfortable.
i enjoyed my morning chats with max at breakfast time and he was more then happy to share some fun stories with me. if you prefer some quiet time, max & jane's fully finished basement offers a space to sit and relax to read a book , watch some t.v, or simply unwind. next time i'm in this area of dc, i will be returning to max & jane's home for sure.
i highly recommend you put this airbnb home on your list when visiting washington dc."
808830,3403780,2013-01-23,4289423,Krista & J.R.,"jane and max were wonderful hosts providing a true bed and breakfast experience complete with delicious gourmet breakfasts, engaging conversation, and inviting home.  the location is a great balance of convenience and class with easy access to downtown in a high-end neighborhood.  will certainly stay there again in the future."
808830,3423390,2013-01-27,4776390,Lizann,"jane and max are fabulous hosts with a beautiful home in a great family neighborhood that feels completely safe at night and quiet without any traffic noise.  i stayed with them for 3 nights in january and would highly recommend them to anyone!

the bedroom feels very private, roomy even if there are two people, nice natural light from the windows, and impeccably clean.  good closet and drawer space for your clothes, a desk for computer work, very comfortable bed with new linens, and an attached bath all to yourself.  jane has set it up beautifully with little extras like granola bars, spring water, shampoos and soaps that make you feel special.  

the first floor is beautifully furnished, spotless, and has a gourmet kitchen that's elegant for breakfast or an evening conversation.  the lower floor has a comfy couch and privacy for watching tv or a movie.  parking is easy, but ask their advice about taking a taxi in the evening because residential parking fills up at the end of the day.  the bus line is incredibly convenient and safe, with just a quick ride to the subway at dupont circle, and local shops and restaurants 2 blocks from the house provide everything you need.  

jane and max are warm, engaging, fun, and great conversationalists - with a clear sense that you can visit with them or have time to yourself, as you prefer.  their enjoyment of meeting new people really shows!  and their little dog bella will think you are wonderful.  i felt very welcomed, and free to come and go as i pleased.  max is often home during the day and offers quick advice about whatever you need.  so - go enjoy their home and their great hospitality!"
808830,3784609,2013-03-14,652070,Derek,"we loved jane & max's place and would stay again if we had a chance.  jane and max are lovely hosts, and very helpful with ideas and suggestions on what to see and do in dc.  we especially appreciate letting us know about the city biking options, as we like to bike and walk, and these made our trips around the monuments and national mall great fun and an inexpensive option."

we were lucky to stay for three nights at jane and max. they were both very friendly, helpfull and it was interesting to talk to them, a really nice  rowhouse in a calm neighborhood, located close to georgetown. we enjoyed the delicious breakfast including fresh fruit. max really made good proposals. one of the best was renting bikes from a station close by (""capital bike share"") and another was the visit of the fantastic ""newseum"". we can really recommend this accommodation."
808830,4185872,2013-04-16,4672934,Janet,"they say a house has four dimensions not only three: the way to and from the house. we so enjoyed staying with max and jane, not only because our room and bathroom were cozy and quiet and included everything we need but also because their house and its suburban location gave us the feeling what it would be like to be residents of washington. glover park is really an extension of georgetown and the 10 minute bus drive to dupont square was pure pleasure. we also enjoyed our open conversations with jane and max. we greatly recommend."

808830,4594477,2013-05-14,1909686,Joanne,"it is my pleasure to write a review of our weekend with jane and max. their house is beautiful and immaculately clean. the bedroom is comfortable and private with its full bathroom. mornings were fun - delicious homemade breakfast, great coffee (and i'm picky) and lively conversation. did i mention the cherry on top?? bella, their tiny, snorting boston terrier. i ended up with more pictures of bella than my graduating son!

the second bedroom is actually a family room. this was a plus since it allowed us to entertain our son and his finance. 

so convenient to american university and georgetown with excellent restaurants within walking distance. we also had a surprising easy time parkiing. if there is a problem, jane and max have a parking sticker to put on your car and a drivieway as well.

808830,6192027,2013-08-03,6324588,Philippe,"washington est une ville extraodinaire par rapport aux autres aux usa.  elle vaut vraiment la peine d'être visitée.  si en plus vous avez la possibilité d'être accueillis par jane et max, dans les faubourgs de washington, au calme, dans la verdure, votre séjour n'en sera que meilleur.

max est aux petits soins pour ses hôtes.  ils n'hésite pas à ouvrir sa maison tôt le matin pour accueillir les visiteurs et garder leurs bagages avant leur première nuit.  il connait tous les bons plans et n'hésite pas à partager sa carte de métro le premier jour.

la nuit se passe au calme et le petit déjeûner copieux est servi à l'heure qui vous arrange le mieux.  c'est l'occasion d'un partage entre l'hôte et ses invités.

le soir, c'est jane qui vous accueille et s'intéresse à votre journée.

le centre de washington n'est qu'à 20 minutes en transport en commun, très facile d'accès et fréquemment désservi."

overall, a 5 star experience!

can't forgot the warm of the night we got wet in the rain, can't forgot each varies breakfast max prepared, can't forgot the cheerful greeting we had everyday jane did, also always remember bella's welcomed barking.  anyway, thank you very much jane, max and bella within cold & terrible whether and shutdown everywhere of washington d.c. but gave us so many sweet memeries.
we definitely recommend the place of jane & max and will stay with them again once any chance to visit washington d.c.

808830,8186077,2013-10-20,4801705,Niko,"what a great experience staying at jane and max's!  both of them are wonderful people, always willing to help us out with any of requests and questions, and always eager to accommodate our needs. 

overall, the house is very well kept and clean. both rooms where we stayed were comfortable and cosy. i stayed in the basement and although i was afraid at the beginning that it would be too dark or claustrophobic, it was not the case at all. the windows provided adequate sunlight and the room was spacious enough. the first floor double bedroom was quite comfortable with windows overlooking the quiet neighborhood.

the bathrooms and toilets were also very clean and we were so happy with the sense of cleanliness of the bed sheets and towels. 

finally, breakfast!  max is the grand chef and he never disappointed us :) very rich breakfast with freshly cut fruit, cereal, omelette frittata, juice and coffee. this can definitely keep you going till lunch!

one more thing: if you are italian (or know how to speak italian) you will make max (or better massimo in italian) double-happy. he was born and raised in italy and he is always eager to practice his mother tongue. it happens that i know italian myself and he didn't miss the opportunity. this place is definitely italian-friendly :)

828497,4181118,2013-04-16,5090508,Ruthann,"what a wonderful experience and lovely home!  sheri and lott were perfect hosts who had thought of everything and made us feel right at home.  although we were busy helping out our son and daughter-in-law with our newly born granddaughter, it was nice having our own quiet, comfortable place at night.  the furlott home is in a beautiful, tree-lined neighborhood which is within a pleasant walking distance to the grocery store and restaurants.  it was perfect!"
828497,4218965,2013-04-19,5597943,Beth,"sheri has a lovely home with beautiful and comfortable indoor and outdoor spaces. her bushes were just about to bloom and the yard is probably spectacular just about now! 
the neighborhood is quiet and safe. the house is in a great location between two metro stops. we had a car, but used the metro to see the sights. 
my brother and i were in town to visit my daughter at american university and we were just a short distance to campus. 
sheri and lot were very warm and accommodating and made us feel welcome. tom and i looked forward to engaging and informative conversations when our paths crossed with theirs. their dogs hopi and mina were very sweet and well-behaved! 
sheri was flexible around check-in and check-out. in addition to the tour of the house and property when we arrived, she provided a binder with detailed information about the house and about the area - including some maps of the area, restaurants, etc. the kitchen was well outfitted and it was a real plus having breakfast available in the house. 
we would highly recommend their cozy home to friends and family - for a long or short stay - and hope to return again, ourselves!"
828497,4678143,2013-05-20,5601919,James,"sheri was just as advertized.  two comfy bedrooms and two baths in a convenient place, fairly close to the metro (which we didn't use.)  the hospitality and amenities were excellent, complete with professional behavior and the like, and the real highlight was her two dogs - cute and cuddly and enthusiastic, yet gentle and friendly.  i'd say our entire group enjoyed each other.  highly recommended.
"
828497,4854684,2013-05-28,418706,Josephine,"sheri and lots' home is in a beautiful tree-lined suburb with easy street parking and easy distance to the centre of dc. on their advice we took our car and parked at the national cathedral and caught a free trolley bus from there.
their friendliness and hospitality was much appreciated and it was great to have a bathroom for each bedroom. 
and so lovely to meet their beautiful dogs, each of which has its own remarkable story. and there were squirrels in the pretty back yard!
it was quiet and private in the upstairs bedrooms.
we booked at short notice and arrived mid evening which our hosts very kindly accommodated.
 i would certainly recommend this home to other travellers."
828497,5069187,2013-06-10,3331608,Rebecca,"sheri was a lovely host with two incredibly friendly dogs. the location was incredibly convenient-only a couple of blocks from the van ness metro and a really nice 50 minute walk from georgetown. sheri herself was helpful, accommodating, funny and really nice. she also responds very quickly to messages and requests. be sure to let her know ahead of time if you'll need to park a car, because she has to go and pick up a specific permit for each car. i would recommend her and her place to anyone looking for a quiet and convenient one or two bedroom place in dc."
828497,5462977,2013-07-01,263004,David A.,sheri & lot provide a great space for their guests.  the location is convenient for public transport and we were able to park across the street with the provided parking permit.  you better love dogs because these will love you and it's their house.

828497,9236413,2013-12-16,383075,Sarah,"i spent 4 months with sheri & lot and their friendly golden retrievers while interning in dc. they were all incredibly welcoming and made for a quiet, clean, and comfortable stay which was just what i needed as a student finishing up graduate school. the place is an ideal location near running trails, buses to georgetown/downtown, nearby metro, along with groceries, take-out and dry cleaning within walking distance. highly recommended for both short and long term stays!"

eastern market was great ... judging by the length of the queue the breakfast must have been superb but we didn't have time to wait.

georgetown was beautiful, as was alexandria.

all your green spaces are so well kept - you should be so proud of these, and of your very courteous drivers and kind welcoming us citizens - always friendly and happy to help.

the apartment was perfect being located in a very attractive neighbourhood with easy access to central washington and surrounding area. the interior was very comfortable, clean and well equipped suiting our needs in every way. it also had an excellent book selection!

dawn and justin were excellent hosts - very attentive and helpful.  we would highly recommend this apartment to anyone wishing to visit washington.

location:
this place is close to dupont circle/georgetown area.  great restaurants and bars.  it is also a cheap cab ride away from the national mall.
amenities:
this room has everything a hotel room has plus more!  it has a great walk-in  closet, a private bathroom, and a large *comfortable* bed.  good sofa and tv set-up as well.  most importantly its clean and you can tell the hosts spent sometime thinking about aesthetics and quality.  also, hosts are open to requests that you may have in terms of extra things you might need.  (they provide clean linens and towels)

logistics:
you get your own key to the main door property, so you can move in and out as you please.  tony was always a text/phone/email away, so it was very easy to communicate back and forth.

overall, i felt comfortable and safe.  i will definitely hope that this location is available on my next visit. "
860336,3862602,2013-03-22,5223762,Kathleen,"our stay at tony's airbnb was the first ever with this host and with airbnb. 
 initially somewhat unsure of this adventure, we were exceptionally pleased with the experience. 
tony's space is better appointed than most of the hotels we viewed for many times his price.  
the bed was extremely comfortable (and i almost always complain about beds...but not this one, it was very cozy!!)  the closet was generous, the bath was a real retreat, with deep tub and lots of light. plenty of plush towels. the location was convenient to everything we needed in dc. 
i would highly recommend tony's dupont dream suite to anyone...the accommodations, the location and the host are all top notch. 
what a pleasure to ""discover"" tony for ourselves, we plan to visit again at our first opportunity.   "
860336,3943659,2013-03-29,1282373,Tome,"with this place one really can't ask for much more. you have a suite all to yourself, comprised of a full bath, walk-in closet, a bedroom with a small couch and coffee table in an adjoining space, and plenty of natural light. the second-floor room was comfortable, spacious, and clean. what is more, the home is conveniently located nearby the dupont circle metro station, in a lovely and quiet residential neighborhood. the host, tony, was courteous and helpful. this kind of accommodation, in a city such as washington, dc, will set you back at least a few hundred dollars (though probably more). tony's place met and surpassed my expectations."
860336,4014675,2013-04-02,348402,Lucas,"we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay! the host was everything that could be hoped for - knowledgeable, easy to speak with and full of useful and interesting suggestions.
the suite was exactly what we had been hoping for - a full bath, spacious walk in closet, and the bedroom had been thoughtfully furnished and decorated. the bed was comfortable, and the surrounding windows offered plenty of sunlight in the daytime, while the double-shades were tasteful and functional, keeping us feeling comfortably private at night.
the location of the home was as ideal as the host and the room! being right new dupont circle, it was close to everything, while still quiet and comfortable.

i highly recommend this spacious, comfortable suite to anyone who wants easy access to downtown!"
860336,4038433,2013-04-04,773580,Paula,"tony's place was tastefully decorated, clean, welcoming, and convenient to dupont circle. tony was friendly and forthcoming with information about dc. we totally appreciated the firm, comfortable bed--and the clothes steamer too. would stay here again!"
860336,4128259,2013-04-12,2746727,Michelle,"i had a delightful stay at this home in dupont. the location was perfect and the hosts had many recommendations for good food (and coffee) in the area. every little detail to make life comfortable had been considered, such as fresh fruit, iphone/blackberry chargers in the wall and a tv loaded with many channels (and movies recorded by the host). the bed was very comfortable and both the suite and the home was full of original and interesting artworks. itwas my first airbnb experience and i felt extremely welcome and relaxed in this home. i can not recommend it highly enough if you are considering a stay in washington."
860336,4213210,2013-04-19,5325030,Janis,"tony's suite is exactly as pictured...clean and private. the location could not have been more perfect...close to dupont circle and public transportation. tony was helpful with information about the area, sights to see, where to eat, etc. we would whole heartedly recommend this suite and would return again. our stay in d.c. was fabulous!

my two italian friends fiammetta and elisabetta were very delighted by your home, the room and the neighborhood. they found it very clean and they loved the new bathroom. it was easy for them to find the address.  they also liked the fact that it was close to the white house, only a 20' minute walk away.
i will definetly recommend you to future friends who would like to travel to washington.  thank you for making their brief visit possible on such short notice.

all my best,

"
860336,7033683,2013-09-04,6119711,Jeremy And Lindsay,"tony was a great host, communicating clearly with us and accommodating.  looking at the pictures, we decided that the room would certainly be fine for four adults and a baby.  he tried to warn us that it might be a bit small, and he was right.  so, it was a wonderful location, but a bit of a tight fit for four adults and a child.

make sure to get food recommendations from him! :)  he knows the neighborhood very well and his taste in pizza is exquisite :).

i arrived at the airport and was a little overwhelmed by the metro schedule (no sham (website hidden by airbnb) was a public transportation rookie!) deb made sure i took the correct lines to get to the waterfront in a timely (and cost-effective) fashion. the location of the barrel house was great; within walking distance of the waterfront metro entrance. she walked from her place and guided me back to my temporary home. deb was very clear on instructions and general information in regards to coming and going.

i was nothing short of impressed with deb's home. there was a pleasant smell in the air, it was very clean and orderly, and most importantly - i felt comfortable there. it was the perfect place to come home to each night after finishing up with the day's tasks. 

i had a very busy schedule planned for my time in dc, so unfortunately, i didn't get much time to personally connect with deb. however, in the short time we were able to chat, i found that she was a very pleasant woman with a great energy surrounding her. she was helpful as a local upon being asked any questions about dc and considerate enough to leave me a couple books and an awesome map. 

i highly recommend staying at the barrel house. if i return to dc, deb will undoubtedly be the first person i contact about overnight arrangements.

879105,4885062,2013-05-31,4618047,David,"i stayed with michelle for three months in a private room in the main house. this is a first class airbnb listing and i had a fantastic time.

michelle is a warm, kind person, always willing to help out and offer advice. she devoted a great deal of time and energy to making sure i had a comfortable and happy stay. this was my first time living in a shared house, so i was apprehensive at first about how things would work out, but i never felt awkward or unwanted around the house. in a very short space of time, michelle really made me feel like i was part of the family.  

the room itself is large and very private with a desk and ample storage space. the house overall well-furnished and beautifully decorated. the kitchen is excellent. i often used it to cook and store food. the shared living space is also very pleasant. 

one of the best features of this house is its central location: it is a short walk away from two metro stops, the us capitol, the library of congress, the supreme court, eastern market, barracks row and the national mall. being so close to the blue and orange metro lines means you can access other parts of dc with ease.

i would highly recommend michelle's place to anyone looking to stay in d.c. for a few days or a few months."

the apartment is spacious and comfortable. art decorates the walls, the bed is comfortable, and the water hot. rodney was super friendly and helpful, even going so far as to leave beer and gatorade in the fridge and recommending places to go out to at night.

the apartment doesn't have wifi, but that wasn't an issue for me - i was here to explore dc and see friends, not sit inside on my computer.

886283,3751355,2013-03-11,3222924,Dong,"katy was a wonderful host! the place was literally 5 minutes away from american u's washington college of law where my friend and i were in for a competition. the room was a five-star standard complete with a private bathroom (including towels), walk-in closet, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee machine, ground coffee, teabags, cream, honey, some cereals etc. my friend and i were positively surprised and the stay was very pleasant. katy also helped my friend and i in a tight spot very good naturedly. the room was spacious and clean and extremely comfortable to stay in. if you need to be in the neighbourhood and are looking for a comfortable, safe place to stay, this would be the place i recommend! "
886283,4076853,2013-04-08,5175938,David,"my wife, child, and i stayed at this apartment when we needed to vacate our dc apartment for five weeks.  katy was an incredibly accommodating and gracious host.  the place is well situated in respect to american university and a ten minute walk to the metro (red line).  i'd stay there again!

"
886283,4283689,2013-04-24,5635122,Nalini,"i had a pleasant stay at katy's in early april.  the spring weather turned rather cold, for which i was not prepared.  the shops close by were very convenient for my two-week stay.  however, the nearest metro station was a fairly long trek.  i found that he bus service connected with dupont circle, but it ran less frequently on weekends.  if you have a car, this should not be a problem.  "
886283,4667875,2013-05-19,4861453,Jamie,"sorry i never met katy but she has a lovely family, and her mum settled me in very kindly. so overall huge thumbs up. the neighbrohood is beautiful- leafy, green- a pleasure to walk thru. it is worth knowing that the metro is  15 mins walk or so- but i cycled everywhere which is basically straight down the hill on mass ave to get downtown (bit tougher coming back) and a chital bike station v nearby. the flat is perfect- own entrance, little drinks and whatnot left out which was kind- and lots of space. i would totally come back here when next on business in dc. "
886283,5175327,2013-06-17,5230203,Josselyn,"the place was amazing, especially because my two friends and i went to study at american university and walked 3 minutes to the university. the place is very peaceful and private. katy always was friendly and helped us in what we needed. this is 100% recommended."
886283,5258244,2013-06-21,3634082,Annika,"katy and her family were just as sweet as can be and very welcoming! the apartment was in perfect walking distance for our tours of american university and an even shorter walk to the bus that took us straight into dupont circle or to the metro (which katy provided very detailed directions for both). the neighborhood was gorgeous, comfortable and very centrally located! would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends visiting d.c.!"
886283,5380877,2013-06-27,6211767,Ellen,"a comfortable home away from home in a quiet, pretty neighborhood.  i've already made plans to stay with katy again in a few months. "
886283,5844071,2013-07-19,463223,Andy,"i just spent 10 nights at katy's house.  it was exactly what i was hoping for when i made my reservation.  the apartment was very clean and private.  katy and her mom pat are wonderful host, they were even considerate enough to have drinks in the refrigerator and a few snacks waiting for me.  i hope to come back next summer for a month.  the metro is a 15 minute walk away from katy's house so getting downtown to see the sights was very easy for someone who has never used a transit system. 
thanks for making my trip so pleasant katy and pat."
886283,7253139,2013-09-13,45182,Tom,"katy made the many small things easy and comfortable--arriving late, doing laundry, soap and shampoo for the shower, finding something to read (a stocked book case!), coming and going, getting the layout of the neighborhood.  i liked the presence in the yard of children's toys and the occasional sound of running small feet.  nary a hitch in the whole process of booking, arriving, staying and leaving.  thanks, katy!"
886283,7977396,2013-10-11,4008984,Nicole,"we have stayed at katy's basement apt. for a month and had nothing but all the good things to say about our experience. the apt. is very cozy, private, clean, and has all the essentials needed away from home, most importantly, the neighborhood is extremely safe. katy is very generous and kind. during our stay at her place, she was unfailingly responsive to our requests/questions.

the house is not close to the metro, but if you don't mind walking, it takes about 20 minutes to get to the tenleytown station, but it's a very nice walk in a quiet and safe residential neighborhood. you will soon find yourself truly appreciate and enjoy the in town convenience the apt. offers."
886283,8154992,2013-10-18,8969676,Jeanne (Eugenia),"katy's basement apartment is in a lovely neighborhood.  the apartment was very clean and was well equipped with microwave, coffee maker, toaster, tv, ample closet space and good lighting.    just 2 short blocks to a great food market but katy had a variety of breakfast and snack items on hand to ""get us started"". we actually spent little time there during the day, but the space was comfortable for two people with a rocker and table and chairs for a work space.  it was really more cozy than the internet pictures portrayed.  we had no difficulty finding street parking.  we were glad that we had a private entrance so we did not need to disturb the family with our coming/going."
886283,8207330,2013-10-21,6211767,Ellen,"this was my second stay with katy.  the basement apartment is a very comfortable, private space that has everything i might need during my stay, from snacks to an iron.  i definitely recommend katy's apartment.      "

888029,6932083,2013-08-31,6271566,Nick,"great location, right next to the georgia ave-petworth metro station. easy to get around dc.  

i had no problem with the housemates, everyone is very friendly. 

the room is right next to some big windows facing the street, so it can get pretty loud/bright from the busy street outside. the area gets a little sketchy at night, but overall its fine. getting to sleep definitely took some getting used to (with the noise and lights outside) but it was nothing too awful. 

the house itself is ok, gets a little dirty sometimes but never too bad. 

john is a nice guy too. "
891852,4691585,2013-05-20,5962434,Pharon,"we stayed in ali's place for a week while in dc on a business trip.  we were pleased with the convenient neighborhood, nice space, and wonderful hospitality!  we will definitely stay there again."

902573,4898609,2013-06-01,4912486,Ben,"i stayed here for four months, and it was perfectly good. the bed is quite firm, and could be a bit comfier, but as i understand it i was the first long term guest to use it, and chris has plans to improve it using some sort of mattress topper.

the house itself is great, well equipped and a very sociable, open space. as i said i was here for four months and met only interesting, friendly people.

chris is a good host, friendly, enthusiastic and helpful."

914968,6477274,2013-08-13,6572329,Frederike,"i had a great stay at the home of shauna.  she is a prefect host, open and friendly. she provided me with maps, showed me the area, put tulips in my room, arranged towels and even bought me a washington-post on saturday. her house is clean, the room is very nice. i had my own bathroom. the house is next to the h-street, a hip street, with nice restaurants and bars. it is harder to reach with the public transportation, but rent a bike in the h-street and enjoy sightseeing. "
914968,7753902,2013-10-01,134641,Sara And Phil,"shauna's place was just what we were looking for in our recent stay in dc. well situated in a cool neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and super close to a city bike share rack, shauna's is a great jumping off point for a visit to the nation's capital. 
the house is cute, clean, and comfy, and has two bathrooms so we got our own to use. 
the room had more than we needed, including books, a big useful desk, cable tv, and a handy printout with suggestions for activities in the area. don't be fooled by the pull-out (website hidden by airbnb) a new fangled part regular mattress/part air mattress and it's totally comfy.
shauna herself is easy going and friendly, someone you'd probably become friends with if you moved to dc. she made us a nice little breakfast with tasty fresh berries, english muffins, and really good coffee, yes!"

954211,6106762,2013-07-30,6585300,Anne,"we had a wonderful stay at matt's apartment.  the location is fabulous, right near shops (especially the target 2 blocks away, which came in handy when our luggage was lost for 3 days!), restaurants, and the metro.  the apartment is sunny, clean, modern, and well kept, and is perfect for a couple or a family with kids, especially given the washer/dryer, dishwasher, and bathroom and tub next to the kids' room.  matt is attentive and responsive, and answered my questions right away despite being halfway across the world.  we would definitely recommend this apartment to others, and would stay here again.  thanks matt!"
954211,6202306,2013-08-03,7547365,Kelly,we stayed at matt's place for two nights.  everything was great.  he is really easy to get in touch with if you need him.  the apartment is really comfortable and easy to find.  this is definitely a place we would stay again.

954211,7849368,2013-10-06,6018230,Lucy,matt's apartment was perfect for our 4 days in dc. it is close to the metro and buses and the apartment is well organised and comfortable. matt was a great host.
954211,7988117,2013-10-11,4921625,Alyssa,"true to the photos, clean, classic, modern and convenient... matt's place was perfect for us as we were former dc resident's traveling for work and pretending to be current dc resident's again in columbia heights. even from across the globe, matt was very responsive and helpful in coordinating our visit. thanks, matt and airbnb!"
954211,8366112,2013-10-28,7958229,Malaya,"the apartment is lovely and true to what is described here. matt was a great host and communicated wonderfully, despite business trips to remote areas. he had the apartment cleaned professionally prior to my stay too, so it was hotel-grade really! easy access to the metro and throughout the city too. i was working during my 2-week stay, so also appreciated the quiet indoors. thanks matt!"
956313,6514166,2013-08-15,3777997,Ed,"we were lucky to be the first to stay in jay and mauri's newly refinished basement apartment. it was indeed a most perfect accommodation. everything was clean crisp and modern. it's proximity to public transportation, both train and bus, make it ideal for getting around town. for my wife and i, who visited dc to see our daughter who lives and works nearby, it was the perfect pad. the full kitchen allows you to fix your own meals and grocery stores are nearby for provisions. however, we like being out on the town and do a lot of eating out, both downtown and in the neighborhood. jay and mauri do their best to make your stay enjoyable and pleasant and in the process are very accommodating. we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again and recommend it highly to anyone interested in a home away from home right in the heart of dc."
956313,8635562,2013-11-10,6251687,Edward,"if you are an airbnb newbie like me or an experienced pro, jay and mau are the perfect hosts for a wonderful basement apartment. they are responsive and accommodating, great friendly people to meet. i was here for 4 weeks (for radiologists attending airp, this is ideal). i had zero issues during my stay. the unit itself is alarm protected, bright and modern with new furnishings. the bed was comfortable (though it was a low bed without a box spring for those that have joint issues- see photo). also, the building is a historic row home so the 4-5 steps down to the unit are somewhat narrow and steep. those with mobility issues could have difficulty. there is plenty of closet space, the kitchen is fully-equipped, bathroom clean and spacious. everything you would need is truly provided (pots, pans, utensils, laundry, towels, cleaning supplies). overall the apartment is really large and clean! the location is also convenient; walking distance to tons of restaurants, bars, mall (target, bed bath, grocery store), 5 min walk to metro station/capital bikeshare dock. for somebody like me who needed a really nice place for a few weeks close to the metro, this place was more than i could have hoped for. if you were staying for a few months, it is easily furnished for a longer period. fantastic hosts and a great place to stay in the columbia heights area!"
956313,8870440,2013-11-23,9447802,Ayanfe,"our stay at jay and mauricio's place was wonderful. we stayed in their basement apartment which was furnished very nicely with basically everything you would need. it is exactly what you see in the pictures. besides having everything, it was also very comfortable and close to the metro. my boyfriend and i really enjoyed our stay and will recommend this place to anyone. jay and mau were great hosts and the check in and check out process was perfect. thanks for a great stay! "
957734,4084581,2013-04-08,5576050,Michael,"mark and patty provided a hotel-caliber experience in the heart of dc at an affordable price. the space was pristine, they had every amenity a traveler might wish for and some, as well as a fully-functional kitchen-space. mark and patty themselves were respectful of our privacy while at the same time being gracious, accommodating, and responsive hosts. i highly recommend them and their space with no reservations."
957734,4150083,2013-04-14,2777044,Cathey,". the location really is good for getting to most if not all of washington dc area attractions and was an easy and safe walk to my meeting, it is quiet, especially for a friday night in the city,has good lighting for reading in bed or sitting in the arm chair and had all the services i needed in the area."
957734,4206276,2013-04-18,5639719,Ido,great place! really nice clean apartment with everything you could possibly need. mark and patty were more than helpful and assisted us quickly with every question we had. the place is very well located plus it is literally a few steps away from a bicycle renting station. we had a great time! thank you guys.
957734,4312221,2013-04-27,289187,Marjorie,"this is a ground-level apartment offered by the owners who live above the apartment.  the apartment has been completely renovated.  it is modern and clean. feels like a hotel but with the comforts of home.  the apartment is located in a vibrant neighborhood with many restaurants and a grocery store nearby 

i met mark who was very friendly and willing to help in any way. 

i will definitely stay here again."
957734,4363520,2013-04-30,3223525,Kristen,"mark is a great host (we didnt meet patty). the apartment is a superb location, close to everything! its really the best area of dc. we really enjoyed our stay!"
957734,4418887,2013-05-04,4668433,Erin,"this was my first airbnb experience, and i couldn't have asked for more. the unit offers hotel comfort (e.g. impeccably clean, heat blowing on you when you step out of the high pressure shower, a million comfortable pillows, full access cable if that's your thing) in the center of it all at a fraction of the cost of what you'd find nearby. and with all of the light one can hardly tell it's a basement unit. i benefited from prompt, thorough interactions with mark and patty, they're a wealth of information on the area and a joy to correspond with. my only disappointment was that the business that brought me to town kept me from thanking them in person and following up on more of their fantastic recommendations. i hope to return!"
957734,4758557,2013-05-24,5821930,Greg,"this was my first experience with airbnb and i can't say enough good things about it!  this apartment is spotless and contains everything you could possibly need.  the neighborhood is awesome, with food, pubs, and shopping within 1 block.
mark and patty were both gracious and fun.  they have prepared maps and information for the guest and provided personal suggestions to us that were perfect.  
business or vacation guest will love this place.  i'll be back to this one for sure!  "
957734,4919174,2013-06-02,1578075,Gabe,"so, this had to be one of my best airbnb experiences yet. i can't say enough good things about mark and patty, as well as the apartment. the place was somehow even nicer than advertised. it was very clean and perfect size for 1 or 2 guests. mark was nice enough to leave directions around town, and even personalized tips about the area. the location couldn't have been better either. it was walking distance to every attraction worth seeing, and even had a coffee shop and bike share location right on the corner.

all in all, i would highly recommend the place, and mark and patty as hosts. very respectful and accommodating people, and enjoyed a beer and a few great conversations them. next time i go back to dc i don't see any reason to stay any place else."
957734,5007241,2013-06-07,5803654,Ryan,mark and patty were great hosts. mark is full of local knowledge and tips and was always asking what he could do to improve our stay. the apartment was clean and tidy and well provisioned with utensils etc. the location is really central and in a nice neighbourhood. 
957734,5158702,2013-06-16,5705013,Jerry,"we found staying at mark and patty's everything we had hoped it would be...and better! the location in the 14th&p area of logan circle was terrific. lots of restaurant and shopping options within a two block walk. a shared bicycle station is next door, allowing one to enjoy dc for $7.00 per day. there are buses that are going to different points within dc and dupont circle and the metro are less than 15 minutes walking.

as for as the studio, mark and patty have created a very welcoming place to stay while in dc. very clean, plenty of kitchen utensils, electric outlets, towels and bedding, flat screen t.v., wi-fi, clock (website hidden by airbnb) was all there for us. when we needed to get work done during our stay, the apartment was conducive to doing so, but another option that is across the street, is a nice coffee house with wi-fi, comfortable tables and chairs and great coffee.

we would highly recommend mark and patty's place to anyone visiting dc. they were accessible to us if we  had questions, but their pre-arrival e-mails, coupled with the information awaiting us upon arrival, provided most of the information we needed.

we would highly recommend staying here and plan to do the same, ourselves!
"
957734,5451574,2013-07-01,5886854,Silvia,"we stayed in the apartment for four nights and all we can say is that we had a wonderful time. the apartment has everything you need and even more (ac, big closet, traveler guides). patty and mark are great hosts. we got tips for dining and sightseeing. they were so helpful and we could call them whenever we needed something. it's really the perfect location near everything. there is a bike rental just beside the house, a bus station right around the corner, a metro station some blocks away and the white house is a walking distance away. great!"
957734,5673299,2013-07-11,5698906,Marco,"my wife and i were in the us for our honeymoon and stayed with mark and patty in washington, dc.

mark was an excellent host, and had great suggestions on where to dine in the area. although mark wasn't around on our day of arrival, he gave us clear instructions on how to retrieve the apartment keys. he also made it a point to check in on us when he returned, to see whether everything was fine.

the apartment is in a safe and beautiful neighbourhood with nice restaurants nearby. we really loved how the convenience and groceries stores were just around the corner. the room was very well equipped and comfortable. we would certainly recommend this place to anyone who is planning to visit washington, dc!

this was our first experience with airbnb, and mark & patty perfected it."
957734,5841903,2013-07-19,5915267,Ben And Claire,"mark was very welcoming as soon as my girlfriend and i arrived. he gave us exact directions how to get to his place from the bus stop and everything else you need to know about dc. it's a great location close to the national mall and all the museums, as well as restaurants and bars all near by - everything is within easy walking distance. the apartment itself is clean and tidy and accommodated two people very easily, with a mini kitchen and fridge. mark also did a load of washing for us and it was easy to organise an extra night!"

957734,7771965,2013-10-02,6922240,Hugo Et Catherine,"perfect apartment in the basement of the mark and patty's house! perfect for a couple. well equipped and very quiet - we almost never heard noise coming from the ceiling.

 very good location for washington, near a lot of restaurants. a few steps away from the door is a ""capital bicycle"" terminal, where you can rent a bike for the day, which is very practical to discover washington.

our arrival was well planed and very easy from union station. a small market is a few meters away, a much bigger one only a street away.

a brand new laundry is also not so far, further on the same street.

a few steps away from the door is a ""capital bicycle"" terminal, where you can rent a bike for the day, which is very practical to discover washington.

i recommend it heartily!

957734,8351345,2013-10-27,9041043,Serena,we had a great stay at mark and patty’s dc apartment.  the apartment is within walking distance to the monuments and national mall so it is a very convenient location to see all the tourist sites.  there is a bike rental station less than half a block away which is handy and a whole foods grocery store about a block and a half away which we appreciated since it meant we didn’t have to eat every meal out (though there are lots of restaurants in the area so you have a lot of options).  most importantly the bed was very comfortable so we got a great night’s sleep!

996138,3988839,2013-04-01,197180,Mathew,"we had a great time staying at grace's house. they definitely took the extra effort to make our trip as comfortable as possible. the house is very well stocked with everything you need on a trip. this is a perfect place for a family or a small group of friends visiting dc. although i don't have kids, i can tell that this is a great place for someone with young kids. location is great and its walking distance to union station and the eastern market. grace and david were always available to answer questions and checked in with us to ensure that everything was going well.
definitely recommend this and would consider going back here on my next trip to dc."
996138,4056365,2013-04-06,3759695,Ralph,"location -- this home is in a great location in dc; just blocks from the metro and the capitol building. lots to do/see/eat within 10 blocks.
experience -- the home was in perfect condition, complete with fresh flowers and even an unopened carton of milk for my kids. grace certainly did everything she could to make us feel welcome. we got the keys without trouble and grace and david were very responsive whenever we had a question. 
recommendation -- absolutely two thumbs up. we've got plenty of experience and this was one of the best. "
996138,4086104,2013-04-08,3559073,Jonathan,"grace's place was a great location, close to union station if you are getting to dc by bus and close to the capitol if you enjoy landmarks. the place is very family friendly and in a safe neighborhood. a bus that took us downtown was only a few blocks away. the house was stocked with food that we were able to help ourselves to and a backyard that we used often. there was a live-in nanny with us throughout the stay who was helpful with finding things around the house and around town. grace and her husband were also great with communication and all-around great people to book with. thanks grace!"
996138,4846828,2013-05-28,3150881,Nacho,"grace has been an incredible hostess. she and her family lives on a beautiful and comfortable house in a quite neighborhood. it is just 10 minutes walking to the capitol so you can visit the most important buildings without been worried of taking any transport.

996138,5273075,2013-06-22,5673041,Lisa,"we had a wonderful time at grace's house on capitol hill. the family were actually there for most of the week (they camped in the basement and we had most of the house) which was not their usual arrangement, but we'd agreed on it beforehand... and it has been the highlight of our time in usa so far. grace, david and their family were very thoughtful and engaging hosts and their house was beautifully comfortable. good location, though everything seems close in dc. definitely nicer and more personal than staying in a hotel, plus our kids have had the opportunity to gain a sense of what life is like in an american family. very happy customers, will definitely stay there again when next in dc, if that invitation to stay in the white house doesn't eventuate!"
996138,5410561,2013-06-29,5307921,Bruce,"this washington home in capitol hill is an excellent place from which to visit the city and especially its historic centre. it's a walk from the capitol building and if you want it's also  within reasonable walking distance of the main railway station.  from what we undersatnd capitol hill has undergone regeneration in recent times but to our eyes is a peaceful, elegant and well established neighbourhood. grace's house is very comfortable family home and our hosts were extraordinarily helpful with restuarant recommendations and tips for getting the best from the city."
996138,5624751,2013-07-08,1486107,Annie,"we stayed in grace's lovely home for four nights in july, and it was all that she advertised and more - extremely clean, comfortable, and convenient to everything we wanted to do as ""tourists living like locals""!  with three adults and five children, we had plenty of space and amenities - the kids loved playing in the finished basement and back yard, and the parents loved having no tv to compete with all the learning opportunities our vacation offered.  having 2 free parking spaces was also a huge value, as the hotels we looked at charged $30-40 a day for parking.  our only regret is that we didn't have more time to take advantage of all grace's family-friendly ""insider"" recommendations of things to do. we will definitely have to come back!!

the space was wonderful, homey, and had everything needed to sleep in late, have coffee until noon, and make dinner with daughters. the unit was very well equipped, sunny and comfortable. i believe it was during a heat wave, but it was as comfortable as one could be!  parking made it very convenient, and the location was great. they did manage to get out and see some sights, had a great time and would return without hesitation.

1026034,4681233,2013-05-20,5811898,Benjamin,"i had a great experience staying at joel's studio and cannot recommend it enough.  the location is ideal -- a short walk to the metro, whole foods, and a host of other restaurants and bars.  i actually did not take the metro the entire time i was there except to get to the airport because many touristy things i wanted to see were within an hour stroll.

joel is an all around great guy and a gracious host.  we really enjoyed getting to know him.  he was extremely responsive to any issues and questions that we had.  the studio itself is very well equipped and we were very comfortable there.  the bed has a foam mattress and the area gets a good amount of light.  the tv is equipped so that we could access netflix, hulu plus, and a host of other amenities.

between the host, the location, and the amenities, i highly recommend booking with joel for your next dc trip."

i stayed at joel's while i was in dc on business and checked out friday morning before i went to work as he had another guest checking in.  my flight wasn't until late in the evening and joel was happy to keep my beer in the fridge while i was at work and let me come back and enjoy them on his porch in the afternoon while i waited to head to the airport.  

great guy, great place -- i'll definitely stay again when in dc.  this was my first airbnb experience and i can only hope they're all this good.  "

1026034,8127845,2013-10-16,7741699,Geertje,"we enjoyed staying in joels appartment. it was very clean and is located in a nice neighbourhood.  lots of places to eat, get coffee and a wholefoods market if you want to stay in and cook. all the sights are close. 

joel responds very quickly if you text him a question and we should have taken his offer to help us find a parkingplace. we parked in colonial parking across the street from the wholefoods, but it would have been far cheaper, if we drove down to 15th. there are numerous parkinggarages there which are cheaper than colonial. 

all in all we had a very nice stay. "

1126839,5221196,2013-06-18,6808484,Maggie,"the room is as sunny and beautiful as described, as is the house as a whole. it's a wonderful rowhouse just a block from the nightlife on 14th (though far enough that you won't be bothered by noise at night), and two blocks from the u street metro, giving you easy access to everything else in dc. the private room is sparsely decorated, as zoe and ruzgar are still in the process of moving in and fixing the place up, but the couple are welcoming and accommodating, and i can only assume that the house will become an even better place to stay once they're fully settled in. i'd gladly stay with them again given the chance - they're both great for a conversation, and perfectly willing to give advice about the area, or invite you to join them and their friends for drinks."
1126839,5956452,2013-07-23,6460541,Simon & Allie,"zoe and ruzgar are generous, wonderful hosts! their beautiful home is in a buzzing area of dc, close to bars, restaurants and public transport. the room is spacious, the bed comfortable and having a private bathroom was very handy.

we had a terrific time staying with zoe and ruzgar, who are great fun, friendly and very helpful.

i thoroughly recommend a stay in this room, you'll have a blast."
1126839,8149981,2013-10-18,8196491,Hana,i stayed at their place for about two weeks in october. zoe and ruzgar were very friendly and thoughtful. thier house is very cozy and is located in a perfect location. i don't think you can find any better places to stay in washington d.c.!

 highly recommended if you are staying in town for business or pleasure.

 again...great, friendly, perfect accommodations! peaceful, pleasant neighborhood. lovely people, highly recommend"
1159439,6390554,2013-08-11,6305598,Sean,"i stayed with derrick and henrike for ten weeks this summer while i was interning in washington, dc. they are very gracious hosts and welcomed me into their home just like i was a member of their family. they even baked me cookies when i moved in! the apartment is clean, spacious, and very convenient to public transportation. the p6 bus picks up right in front of the house, and the red and yellow lines are less than a half-mile away. there is also ample street parking if you have a car. i parked my truck on the street all the time and had no problems finding a spot near the apartment. having my own entrance was also very convenient when i had to work late or if i had people over. the apartment was extremely quiet for a basement apartment. the apartment is so quiet that there were times when i could hardly tell when my hosts were home. the kitchenette was the perfect size. i cooked many great meals in the small convection oven. i highly recommend staying here. the bed is cozy, the apartment is quiet but convenient, and the people are wonderful. i had a great experience and can honestly say that i would definitely stay with derrick and henrike again. "
1159439,6878976,2013-08-28,8026487,Lynn,"what a great surprise to be greeted by henrike when i arrived.  she was right there and offered to help me with my luggage.  she is a beautiful lady in all ways.  her husband was just as accommodating and friendly.  the newborn eleanor was delicious... and i loved cuddling her.  you are a wonderful family.

after greeting me, henrike showed me the apartment, gave me the keys to the private entrance, and asked me if i needed anything else.  the apartment was immaculate and made me feel as if i were at my own home.  henrike and derrik provided me with the extra things i had asked for:  tv and wireless connection log-ins, and a radio if the tv was not woking.  that's all i had to do is ask.  although they had access from the main floor, denrike (combination) always knocked and waited for me to invite them in.  i never heard the baby...  they are so lucky to have a happy, contented little girl.
the apartment is located near buses and the subway.  it is also an easy walk to some stores.  i had no trouble getting around (even at my age).  the neighbourhood is just great:  the people are friendly and easy to talk to if you get disoriented.
i had a great experience and i wish the nelsons' much happiness.  
i recommend this airbnb without reservations.

1159439,7268336,2013-09-13,8355852,Sin Chan,"this is my first experience with airbnb. it was unforgettable stay with the host, henrike is so helpful and even text us almost everyday to ask about the stay condition during our stay at washington dc. staying here give us so much privacy and feel likes our own home. the place is clean, nicely decorated and have a big space. access to public transportation is well located either by metrobus or metrorail. everything here is just ""awesome"". we will definitely come back to stay again.

1159439,7317400,2013-09-15,5898226,Bartosz,i very much recommend henrike's place - it is awesome - we couldn't wish anything better than that and it was definitely one of the best airbnbs i've ever stayed in. we were welcomed very warmly and friendly by henrike and derrick and enjoyed a lot staying in their house. i wish we spent longer than just 2 nights there and explored dc more but our schedule did not really allow that.
1159439,7465814,2013-09-21,4267528,Manuel,"my girlfriend and me enjoyed our stay at henrike's place. everything was perfect!!! very clean and well organised. i have to say that it was very nice surprise because the apartment is much better in reality than in the pictures.  
henrike and her family were great hosts, they help us on everything and even they prepared some awesome surprises (the cinnamon cake was amazing). we will stay again in my next visit to d.c!
thank you so much."
1159439,7990856,2013-10-11,9195919,Michael,"henrike and derrick were awesome! i stayed in their downstairs rental unit for four nights while visiting dc for a job interview. henriike accomadated my arrival time and even shot the breeze with me for a while even though it was late. she and derrick helped me out with transportation and provided friendly insight about dc. oh, and the place really nice! thanks!"
1159439,8143859,2013-10-17,9347580,Andrew,"a fantastic basement space which really suited what we needed. a lovely house in a great location, a short ride or nice walk from union station

henrika and derrick where absolutely fantastic hosts. friendly and welcoming, they also made sure that all the little touches were there to make it a great stay. 

would recommend to anyone staying in washington. "
1159439,8229965,2013-10-21,1201575,Shane,"this was by far my best airbnb experience so far. henrike and derrick were just fantastic, gracious and accommodating hosts. the basement apartment is super clean, roomy, quiet, and comfortable. the location is really hard to beat -- about equidistant between three metro stations-- all within walking distance. it was always easy to find street parking for my car--which was only used once during my 4-day stay because the metro is so much more convenient.

derrick and henrike made sure we had everything we needed, offered suggestions for where to go, places to eat, and how to get there. they also accommodated a very late night/early morning arrival which i really appreciated.

this is a great value and you should not hesitate to book it if you are visiting the dc area."
1159439,8355836,2013-10-27,5743957,Ralph,"couldn't be better. the space was big, open, very clean and very comfortable, and the owners above were just wonderful. would *absolutely* stay again. "

henrike & derrick are excellent and charming hosts and always very helpful!!!!!!! and their baby, eleonore, is wonderful!!!!!
everything was perfect, it seemed to be in a suite of a 5 star hotel!!!
it is a perfect location if you arrive by car, while it is a little bit far from the subway if you are not a great walker and if you are tired after a long day exploring the wonderful washington. we would definitely highly recommend it to anyone visiting dc!
thanks again for everything!

1159439,8475511,2013-11-01,9578584,Ben,"derrick and henrike’s basement apartment in dc is a cozy well appointed nest for the business traveler and tourist alike. the residence is easy to access by car from major highways, on street parking is ample, and the metro is an easy 15 min walk away. the bed is comfortable and the entire space is clean, cared for, and quiet. the apartment is secure and easy to access through a private first floor entrance. one can come and go at all hours without disturbing the hosts. i was greeted by both derrick and henrike upon arrival who welcomed and filled me on all necessary matters pertaining to the neighborhood, alternate side of the street parking regulations, and check out. both kept in touch during my visit via text to ensure i had everything i needed for a comfortable stay. the apartment is spacious and laid out well if needed as a temporary base for a small film or photography crew working in the dc area. there’s ample floor space for gear with work surfaces in the kitchen area and living room. i will definitely stay with the nelsons again on return trips to dc. a great spot that feels like home!

and if that wasn't enough, there was a bottle of wine and a sweet message waiting for us when we arrived. needless to say, i'd definitely stay here again when i'm in town. 

hillary, thank you again - happy to have been your first guest!"
1162095,5200630,2013-06-17,2733465,David,"hillary was such a thoughtful host! we spoke on the phone before i came over, and i mentioned i love brunch spots. i arrived to not only a printed list of several top brunch spots, but a bottle of champagne, and walking trails of dc on the counter! she really went above and beyond to make my stay memorable and super comfortable. the apt was very spacious and super clean. would highly recommend hillary and her apt = ).

1177438,5400847,2013-06-28,277071,Justin,"we thoroughly enjoyed fred and kadija's place.  it is in a safe and very convenient location.  there are two major grocery stores within a few blocks and a bunch of nice bars and restaurants surrounding the area.  it is also right next to the new york/noma metro stop which made commuting a breeze.  their place is furnished with nearly everything you could possibly need, from extra bed sheets and towels to all the kitchen utensils one might need to cook a simple meal at home.  being tech savvy people we really enjoyed their blazing fast internet (70+mbits down/15+ up).  kadija called to check in to make sure everything was going ok and was extremely helpful with all of our inquiries.

i was only going to give 4 stars since i'm comparing to some airbnb's that i've stayed at which were far more luxurious, however, i feel it's definitely worthy of a 5 star experience given the price of their place.  thanks fred and kadija!"
1177438,5491358,2013-07-02,3529630,Bryan,"our stay at the railyard district townhouse was excellent!  fred and kadija were wonderful hosts, were exceptionally accommodating, and made us feel very comfortable during our stay. the townhouse is a 5 minute walk at most to the metro and is only 1 stop from union station. there were plenty of towels/bedding, snacks, and  maps/visitor information. we comfortably accommodated 4 adults during our 4 day visit to dc. street parking was available within half of a block. this property is a great value for a visit to the nation's capitol!"

union station (and the capitol also)  is in walking distance.
the house is very nice, fancy and clean with great wifi. the kitchen has everything you need. and the hostess kadija is the best you can have. very friendly, and when we had troubles with the rental car company, she did much more then you can expect from a hostess. when we come back to dc (and we must, because we didn't see it all), we definately go back to the ""railyard district rowhouse"". fred and kadija, thank you so very much!"
1177438,6059886,2013-07-28,5610444,Deb,"great place ideally located for our washington visit. fred and kadija went out of there way to ensure we were well settled on our arrival, not only with everything we could need in the house, but also extra things, like rail cards, supermarket discount cards and maps, to make our stay even easier. great community feel to the area and very close to the national mall- great to run to if you're a runner! clean, comfortable and organised house. we had a great time.

the neighbourhood is very nice and there is an awesome supermarket in 3min walking distance. the only thing i could imagine to criticize is that the next laundromat is about 25min walking distance away.
however, we really enjoyed our stay and we can just recommend to stay at fred and kadija's place!"

1202878,5280940,2013-06-22,6705961,Jane,this is a fantastic place in a great location.  gino was very accommodating.  it is right in the heart of capital hill.  two blocks from the metro and 8th street dining.  the neighborhood is welcoming and safe.  the accommodation were very clean.  i would stay here again and again.  we loved the small outside patio for drinks at the end of the day!
1205516,4870893,2013-05-29,502012,David,"house was easy to find, and decently close to the metro and some of the capital bikeshare. neighborhood was okay -- it's definitely an area that is seeing a lot of improvements because of the stadium. dennis was really helpful and kind. i felt safe there and the accommodations were as expected."

1205516,7622335,2013-09-27,1924650,Brian,"staying at dennis's place worked out really well for me. since i was going solo on this trip i didn't need much space. dennis's brother was there to greet me and show me the house. the room was very clean and the single bed quite comfortable. the location is very convenient. i ended up walking to the national mall rather than take the metro.the smithsonian, capitol building, and monuments are all close by. the waterfront area is only a few  blocks away with good seafood restaurants. i would recommend dennis's house to anyone who is looking for an affordably priced place to stay.

its great that you can use fridge and freezes and cooking facilities, and the bathroom is great, with and additional bathroom on 1st floor. highly recommended, thanks dennis!"
1225965,8863348,2013-11-22,1309422,Stephanie,"yolanda is the consummate hostess, and staying at her place was easily the best experience i've had on airbnb! from the moment i requested the stay to the day i departed for home, she was on top of all the details, made sure i had good directions, even helped me to track down sundries i'd left behind. it was like staying with a good friend who gives you lots of space. 

when i say space, i mean space. the apartment is in a deluxe development about 10-minutes' walk (or 3-minute bus ride) from the cathedral. yolanda vacates to another apartment on a different level of the same large building, so you really do get the whole place to yourself. 

and what a place it is. i live in brooklyn, and the lovely bedroom is the size of my entire apartment! walking into her living room is like entering an in-home art gallery, with plush white carpet, gorgeous art and classical music humming in the background. ahhh ...

the fact is, i figured i'd just crash here at night. instead i found it was a real sanctuary during a harried business trip. thanks yolanda! i hope my work takes me back to dc again, and if it does, i know exactly where i'll stay."
1273717,5970467,2013-07-24,47703,Marjan,"hester and her husband have an old beautiful house next to a peaceful park.  it is nice to be able to hear the birds in the midst of a busy city.  it is a bit of a walk to get to the metro, especially on a hot summer day (or if you are wearing heels!).  but there is a bus around the corner that will take you to it for $1.75.  the house has all the amenities one might need. "
1273717,7307173,2013-09-15,3835719,Kristine,"hester's home was just perfect for us, cosy, comfortable and great location.  hester made us feel right at home, had one small issue but she more than made up for it.  for a family or two couples this house is perfect.. friendly neighborhood, lovely outdoor deck, lots of sunlight and everything working well. even a piano!  i would definitely recommend hester's lovely little row house and will stay here again if i get the chance..

1281015,5668000,2013-07-10,7107881,Luke,"katrice provided an excellent stay in their english basement.  this is a very spacious accommodation. everything has been upgraded to top-notch fixtures, appliances, furniture and beautiful wood floors.  the bathroom is amazing as well with a huge jetted tub, tile-work and multi shower heads.  

things i really appreciated:  
-key-less code entry, so no need to get a key from the owner when you arrive.  
-location. this is about a 5 minute walk from union station, and essentially at the corner of h street and about a stones throw from great restaurants and bars, as well as a brand new grocery store.  
-lots of privacy, it has the feel of your own apartment and living space, no shared space with the owners.  


katrice was an incredible host and reached out in every way possible and answered all of my questions immediately.  she provided food, entertainment and transportation recommendations, she also offered me transportation as well if i needed it.  

would highly recommend this space if visiting dc!  "

1281015,6030493,2013-07-27,2901010,Sheila,"i just returned from a fabulous two-week stay at katrice’s place.

the description of her listing is accurate. the apartment is a short walking distance from union station in a safe neighborhood. i had no problems walking home at night after late dinners. there are many quality restaurants within a few blocks as well as a brand-new grocery store (giant). her basement apartment is newly renovated with ample natural lighting and a beautiful european style spa/bathroom.  the unit is very clean and tastefully decorated, and the bed is very comfortable (i used earplugs at bedtime to muffle the noise from the ac unit). 

words cannot express how very loving and caring katrice is. she kindly offered us (my son and me) transportation from the local airport and gave us a ride to the capitol on a very hot day. she even secured a pass for the tour of the bureau of engraving and printing so that i didn't have to stand in line during the heat wave last week. in short, she went beyond all reasonable expectations and treated us like family.

i very highly recommend her place and shall most certainly return for my next visit in the d.c. area.

1284169,6060339,2013-07-28,7508213,Jennifer,"this place was exactly what we were looking for while staying in the dc area. this first floor unit is nestled nicely within the columbia heights neighborhood, a few blocks from the metro station, shopping center (target, bed bath and beyond, marshalls), capital bikeshare dock, and grocery store (giant supermarket). roya the owner lives above the unit, which is good to know in case there are any immediate pressing issues with the home (we didn't have any though).
 
the home itself is spacious and perfect for a couple. i loved the walk-in closet, updated kitchen, and dining area. the features inside the home were absolutely wonderful. we were blessed with having a washer/dryer, central air conditioning, futon sofa, and cable tv. everything you need is there for you at this location, all you need to bring are your clothes, food to cook, and personal hygiene supplies. roya is such a gracious host, meticulously going over all that needs to be known about maintaining the home and efficiently using all the assorted amenities afforded to us.
 
there were only two minor drawbacks for us as a family with a young toddler. as roya mentioned when we booked the place, there are no toys or books provided. so you’ll have to entertain your children somehow. also, because the surrounding neighborhood itself has some public housing projects, even though most people are friendly, you should just be aware of your surroundings and it’s probably best not to be alone at night."
1284169,7807238,2013-10-04,6921456,Dominique,"we've rented the apartment for 2 month and highly recommend it! roya is a super nice and warm person. she was always very nice and helpful.  

the apartment is perfectly located in dc: the metro, grocery stores, and many nice restaurants are in walking distance. the apartment looks exactly as shown in the pictures and is very nice.

roya, many thanks for hosting us and in particular for the nice time in dc. we're looking forward seeing you next year.

the apartment itself is clean and tidy, has all the required amenities and supplies, and is as advertised. the location is very convenient, close to a large shopping center (including target, giant, marshalls) and restaurants, and is easily accessible through public transport: columbia heights metro station is within walking distance and there are also several bus stops nearby. 
 
roya, thank you so much for your care and efforts to make us feel welcome. we really appreciated it and it was the perfect start to our adventure in dc!

beyond the place, i have found grace and her family to be extremely helpful and attentive to my needs. they  provided plenty of advice on how to navigate washington dc and helped me find a more permanent place to settle in. coming from overseas, i have spent a month at their flat while looking for my final home and enjoyed it very much."

recently, while looking for a longer term lease in dc, i booked an entire apt for one week ... in columbia hts with lexie and graham.  

i really enjoyed my stay with lexie and graham, in their artsy ..  victorian bohemian (wo bedroom apt ..( filled with light, high ceilings)..  they accommodated and were attentive to everything ..   within minutes of any inquiry.  

what i also  loved about the space  was its  proximity to the metro and the neighborhood's many many cafes, restaurants, and shopping areas. .from  11th to 14th, i found myself walking everywhere.

if i had to return to airbnb again... even for a vacation, i wouldn't hesitate to  stay in this apartment ... rented with lexi and graham. "

1488282,8086015,2013-10-15,642392,Michael,"lexi, graham, and sol were incredibly sweet and helpful. this was my first airbnb experience and i can't imagine a better one. we had five adults and three kids and were ready to squeeze ourselves into a small dc apartment. turns out, the place was gigantic. the kids had their own place in the living room with the projector tv for nighttime movies before bed. my wife and i had one bedroom to ourselves, my sister's family had the other. we used the great dining area for game nights or to spread out when everyone was around.
also, the location was really convenient. we were in town for a wedding and most of the events were down the street, literally two blocks away. that is where we found the coupe for breakfast. we loved it so much we ate there every morning. the coffee is strong and delicious and the breakfast was amazing (the cochon de lait benedict was my fav).

1488282,8451158,2013-10-31,4081120,Pete And Naama,"graham and lexie were really warm and amenable hosts, offering lots of help, travel/food/culture advice and good vibes (and from the right kind of distance to ensure our privacy).  we'd come down w/ a toddler and infant, and their first-hand experience w/ such things (combined w/ years-earned knowledge of their 'hood) made for lots of spot-on recommendations for keeping our young ones hooked in, excited and provided for (while also having great tips for the adult side of our equation).  the pad is refreshingly sun drenched in all the right places; very eclectic in room-to-room painting and design elements (our toddler loved this!); mostly pretty clean.  the big-screen projection tv w/ plentiful cable options was a nice nightly escape; modest/tasteful complimentary food and drink left in the kitchen.  only problem for us was access (stroller-bound folk may find the small gate opening and slightly landing-less stairs challenging); in our case (acknowledging the kid-friendly guidance we received), we might leave the kids at home next time. otherwise, we've got graham and lexie on our books!  thanks for the stay!   "
1488282,8501992,2013-11-03,7596851,Dan,"lexie and graham where great hosts and were very attentive to us as guests.  we had a chance to visit with them throughout our stay (they live downstairs) and they're incredibly nice, welcoming and fun people.  

this was a work trip for me along with my wife and a 3rd.  we had to arrive at about midnight the first night and leave very early all three mornings that we stayed there and they were very accommodating to our schedule.  we didn't play on them, but the fact that they have instruments in the living room as well as a projector (which we did use) is awesome.  

on the 2nd day there was a problem with a piece of one of the bed frames slipping out of place; graham took care of it before we went to bed that night and i wouldn't expect the problem to persist.  if anything it's an example of their hospitality.  

a note: they have a very friendly cat who's really sweet and really loves attention.  we enjoyed it, but if you're someone who has a problem with cats you should talk to them about it first so they can keep him downstairs.  

overall i would definitely recommend staying with lexie and graham."
1488282,8689902,2013-11-12,9112118,Honey,"when we arrived they were still on vacation but they arranged for a friend to make sure we were taken care of. the rooms were clean and comfortable. we had everything we needed to feel at home. they even provided parking and train passes. the neighborhood was great and really was near everything. when we finally did get the chance to meet them, they were extremely friendly. thanks to them we had a great time in dc and a great first airbnb.com experience.

1488282,8834596,2013-11-20,7576669,Rachelle,we loved staying there! all the comforts of home. lexie and graham were incredibly accommodating. we would go back in a heart beat.
1488282,9225281,2013-12-15,7039362,Kaspar,"thank you lexie and graham for a unforgetabel stay in your apartement! we, two children and two adolts spent two weeks in a clean, well equiped and quiet home. the neighbourhood is nice and fsave. supermarkets, shops, a londrey and the metro is in walking distance. 
we felt realy home abroad. we get to know washington dc trough lexie and graham even better. we will book again any time in the future."
1488282,9396072,2013-12-26,10385969,Carlos,"what can i say about lexie, graham, sol, and fam...amazing!! from the minute we requested the booking to the minute we said goodbye, they made us feel very comfortable, safe, and happy on what was our very first airbnb experience. they were extremely responsive to every email, text, etc. even when they were not going to be around when we arrived they made it very easy to get the keys and not have to wait until they arrived. 

now about the property...awesome!! the location could not have been any better and for a few days we really felt as if we were dc regulars. very close to the sights, restaurants, public trans, shopping centers, etc. my family and i fell in love with the space and it is everything they advertised and more. there was plenty of space for the five of us--my wife, 3 teenage daughters, and myself--to move around without falling all over each other. 
the kitchen was fully stocked and we were able to make a christmas eve feast that we will not soon forget. we also had fun playing the instruments that they made available (how cool is that?) and utilized the awesome projector and sound system to have an memorable movie night. 

all in all, i can not find a single thing to complain about and would gladly stay with lexie, graham, sol and family anytime we are in the dc metro area. cheers!

"
1488282,9435310,2013-12-28,1476159,Jamie,"lexie and graham were perfect hosts for our holiday family trip. the apartment was nicely sized for 6 people with two full bedrooms, a nice pullout and an air mattress. 

the neighborhood was really cool: we ended up having a great brunch at the coupe, then just walking for hours until we ended up in the national zoo with all it's lovely xmas lights. our family has done the monuments and museums scene a bunch, so the location of the apartment allowed us to get a real feel for dc living. it was great!

to top it all off, graham came up in the evening with freshly baked scandinavian holiday cookies and a nice bottle of red wine. then we settled down to watch a movie on their huge projector. amazing!

tl;dr great hosts, great apartment, great location. book it!"

1498731,8930503,2013-11-26,9508726,Virginia,"what a fabulous place! easy, short walk to metro, clean, attractive, safe, great restaurants (website hidden by airbnb) family & i had a wonderful experience while staying in this apartment. cliff checked on us by email to be sure all was satisfactory....
all in all, probably the best airbnb experience we have had, city-side!
we highly recommend this place."
1498731,9177989,2013-12-11,8652398,Karena,"great central location for vacation/work time. close to the convention center and also in reasonable walking distance to the many attractions and sights. the apartment was pretty well fitted out, with almost everything you might need for a 10 day stay. unfortunately the wifi access was only available in the kitchen and the back bedroom, which was not really convenient for working. as a basement apartment, it was a very dark space with the only daylight coming in from the 4 very small windows at the front of the property, to have been expected but still dark! sufficient towels and blankets and bed linen for the 3 of us. the one other downside was the bathroom door squeaked, which meant anyone visiting the bathroom, which is in the back bedroom, in the night generally woke up the sleepers!
however in spite of the minor irritations, it was a great place to stay for our 10 day vacation (3 adults) and i guess if i wanted more daylight i should have paid the extra for one of the apartments on the floor above. of note sound travels down from the apartment above, but that happens everywhere.
i would recommend this apartment for a family visit. thank you. "
1519460,7421225,2013-09-19,812484,Christopher,i had a great time staying in washington d.c. the property is in a very quiet neighborhood. the deli on the corner is very convenient and the capital bikeshare was much better than the metro. i didn't care for the cable television because it made my friends and i watch movies instead of leaving the apartment. 
1519460,7519122,2013-09-23,2270537,Al,"this was one of the best airbnb spaces i've stayed at.  looks exactly in person as it does in the pics.  very clean, spacious and the location was ideally close to the convention center where i was working during my stay there.  the bed was pretty comfortable as well.  cliff and paul were very responsive and helpful before and during my stay.  the only negatives to consider: it is a 3rd floor apt with no elevator and narrow stair case.  if you have a lot of heavy baggage, just be prepared for a workout lugging them up and down.  the wifi was also a bit spotty for me.  not sure if that's always the case, but i had a bit of trouble staying connected.  if you're really internet dependent like i am, you may want to bring a personal hotspot, which got me by.  otherwise i would definitely love to stay here again on any future visits to dc.  "
1519460,8453227,2013-10-31,9554197,Cory,"the apartment location was ideal. only three blocks from the convention center and many restaurants etc. the instructions to get in were easy. apartment was clean. price was outstanding compared to a hotel room, and included a full kitchen, laundry, internet was fast and reliable. this is a nice mid level space priced right. not luxurious, but presentable and accurately marketed. thank you gentleman for allowing me to reside in for 3 days while in town on biz. i would definately recommend.

1534470,8298878,2013-10-24,9185386,Jenee,"we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this unit. we struggled with whether or not to get hotel rooms for the four of us who were staying in dc for business and i am so happy we found cliff's place instead. the location was within walking distance to the metro and everywhere else we needed to go. the ease and comfort of having your own space is immeasurable and this unit offered that. it had two complete sitting rooms and each of the rooms were far enough from the next that none were inconvenienced by noise. not only will we recommend this to  others but are considering using it on our next business trip as well.
 four stars- everything was as promised."
1546656,7348688,2013-09-16,8626889,Tyler,"this was my first time using airbnb and it was a great introduction to the community. amy was a fantastic host--very accommodating, considerate, and attentive. she helped me find the place, worked with my schedule to meet and get the keys, and checked in with me to make sure i was taken care of during my stay.  

the apartment is in a great location near to public transportation, grocery stores, restaurants, shopping, and street parking, etc; pretty much everything you need. her place is very clean and tidy, fully equipped kitchen, fast wifi connection, and full of resources on local attractions and maps. she was sure to leave us clean linens, towels, and individual toiletries. 

considering it was my first time using airbnb, amy set a pretty high standard. i can only hope the rest of the community can match this precedent."

1571112,8189703,2013-10-20,7742282,Yoko,"marcy is a very caring and gregarious host who enjoys life and arts.  she was very responsive during the pre-trip period and once on-site, provided helpful suggestions for local restaurants and cultural spots in the area.  

her beautiful apartment is located in a great neighborhood of tree-lined streets, historic buildings, foreign embassies, numerous restaurants, sidewalk cafes and the like, within a short and safe walking distance to both dupont circle and adams morgan, and also walkable to gwu, world bank, lincoln memorial, georgetown and the white house.  

adorned with beautiful paintings, the apartment is very comfortable, spacious and airy.  you'll find everything you need in the full-stocked kitchen, bathroom, large living room and peaceful bedroom.

i'd highly recommend marcy and would love to return to her apartment for my next visit to dc in the future.

1571112,8347436,2013-10-27,8512062,Alex (& Jill),"i'm afraid to say how fantastic this apartment (and marcy!) is; i fear there will never be an available time slot  for me to return !!! the apartment is beyond adorable and welcoming. that marcy has gorgeous taste and cared about comfortable furniture is one thing--but this apartment had every ""little"" item one might desire (magnifying mirror, scissors, coasters, hooks, mood lighting, reading lighting, hair dryer,  much etc). we ended up bringing dinners back to the apartment in order to enjoy ""our"" little nest! there's a desk and a large coffee table to accommodate the ever growing ""treasures"" one gathers on vacation, and lots of drawer and closet space. the location of the apartment is ideal; we zipped around on the metro and reveled in all the fabulous nearby nieghborhoods
 on top of all that, marcy is a sweetasaurus rex; she could not have been more responsive and charming. a perfect visit!"

the apt. is spacious (we travelled with 3 big kids and there was plenty of bed space) one bathroom is a push with teenagers but we made it fine. 

there are a couple of nearby grocery stores and a really great deli/bakery on the lincoln sq & a few blocks down the way is a good choice of local bars and restaurants.

a great choice if you want to explore the capital & its many treasures.

thanks very much cliff!"

it was a quick 5 minute drive to union station, but allow extra time at rush hour.  we would highly recommend this place and will stay here again if we ever need a place in dc.

there was a little incident of the garage opener not working so we could park in the back but sejal was quite responsive in addressing that."

my questions/communications were always answered promptly and in full; both angelica and sean offered solid advice about public transit, where to get the perfect cup of coffee, the neighborhood in general. i would recommend this flat to anyone interested in staying in the capital hill neighborhood -- perfect for 2-3 people."

even though we arrived before check-in, the royals let us put our bags in their house until the suite was ready. they were completely accommodating from the moment we arrived until the minute we left.

if we ever return to dc, we'll definitely see if this place is available again. oh, and i almost forgot, they had a brita filter in the fridge! as a bottled-water hater, i was very happy to see that."

location:  about a mile from the capitol - 4 blocks from good food on h street - and two blocks from the bike-share racks (great way to get around.)

place:  clean, comfortable and well stocked.

hosts: friendly and helpful.

only thing to note is the hosts have two young kids in their house above you and you will hear running, footsteps and voices during the day.  did not bother us at all but if you are someone who like it very quiet - it would be something to be aware of.

overall fantastic experience and would recommend this place to everyone."

my husband and i stayed at sean & anjelica's apt over the  xmas holidays. we were extremely happy with the apt and  felt that  it exceeded our expectations. we also felt that the pictures on airbnb did not do it justice. the apt was very tastefully decorated and very comfortable. it was fully equipped with everything  we needed (refrigerator, microwave., stove, coffee maker/coffee etc) and it even had a real bed/bedroom.  it was very cold when we arrived in dc so we were very pleasntly surprised to find the apt nice and warm when we arrived,, a much appreciated touch! the apt is centrally located; walking distance to attractions and restaurants. this was our first time in dc but it won't be our last and when we do go back we will definitely want to stay at this apt. lastly, although we did not meet anjelica and sean we did communicate quite lot with sean and found him very pleasant and very quick to respond to any queries.  over all we we were very happy with our stay/apt/hosts and would most definitely recommend it."

1641184,8224972,2013-10-21,4376430,Jenna,"meeting rae was definitely one of the highlights of my trip.  i truly can't say enough wonderful things about my experience here.  the location is beautiful and the room is more than comfortable.  i was in dc for a conference and rae was beyond hospitable - she was kind enough to give directions, suggest restaurants, and very helpful in assisting a small town child like myself navigate dc. ;)   i've had great experiences with airbnb but this was by far the best.  i would definitely look to stay with rae during any return visits to dc.  absolutely a 5-star host and a truly wonderful experience."
1641184,8322747,2013-10-25,1778973,John,rae was an excellent host and this is a cozy place in an upscale building situated in an ideal location close to happening neighborhoods and convenient to the metro. i will definitely look for opportunities to stay here again.
1667080,8533697,2013-11-04,8673524,Curtis,"my two and a half week stay in this noma studio was fantastic. the apartment itself is brand new, super clean and efficient. it has everything you need. super close to the metro, starbucks and lots of cool restaurants. as far as the hosts themselves, they were incredibly respectful. privacy is never an issue. in fact i never saw them once. if you are thinking of booking here don't hesitate. i was very happy and wouldn't have wanted anything about it to be different."
1667080,8706083,2013-11-12,6825964,Gerard,"communication and checkin was first class. tony's place is just around the corner from union station. the self contained apartment had everything i needed to enjoy my stay in dc. was able to cook meals in the kitchen, the bathroom was immaculately clean, the bed was comfy and the tv had cable. the area is very secure and safe and has some really cool bars and restaurants close by. you can't beat this pace for value for money. love dc, wish i had another month at both dc and tony's place. there was also the utmost respect for my privacy. thanks again tony."
1667080,9413140,2013-12-27,10544146,Stefano,"tony and his wife were great hosts. the apartment is close to metro, the grocery store is a two block walk and tony went out of his way to make me feel at home even securing a parking pass for me.  would highly recommend."
1725435,8989358,2013-11-30,9406308,Yuriy,"чисто, но пустынно. нет одеяла на ночь (лишь простыни), пришлось спать в одежде укрывшись наматрасником. :-) нет полотенца. 

чай с сахаром хозяйка привезла по моей просьбе (но лучше иметь свой). 

обязательно позвоните перед приездом за час - хозяйка живет в другом месте, ей требуется время, чтобы доехать. другие комнаты могут сдаваться другим жильцам.

подойдет для продолжительного пребывания большой молодежной компанией, если есть свои полотенца и спальные мешки. если будете снимать больше 1 дня - попробуйте попросить скидку. 

неудобно добираться на общественном транспорте. лучше если вы будете на машине. район города считается криминализированным, вечером было немного стремно идти пешком одному до дома от автобуса. цена за предоставляемый сервис завышена."
1761677,9334603,2013-12-22,2361365,Lisa,"i booked maj's house for four of my coworkers from indonesia to stay at while they were visiting dc for a 10 day work trip.  they all had a fabulous time staying in this beautiful house and were sad to leave.  the location was perfect, nearby lots of shops and restaurants, and convenient to the metro, yet on a quiet and peaceful street.   they took advantage of the spectacular kitchen to cook their own meals on a few occasions.  while the there was a problem with the heater the first day they arrived, maj responded to their emails immediately and quickly remedied the problem.   the house was immaculate when they arrived and a house cleaner came mid-week to clean the house again. overall i would highly recommend this house for a group or family visiting dc.   "
1761677,9430267,2013-12-28,7468644,Deborah,"this is a beautiful, stylish home, and it was the perfect setting for a christmas for our scattered family. the kitchen, dining area and living room are all contiguous and very inviting.  we felt at home right away.  we were greeted by neighbors' kids who had just fed the fish and were using the swing in front of the house, provided by the host.  maj responded immediately to a few basic questions even though she was 8000 miles away.  this home has a very well equipped chef's kitchen, and the african art is a very nice addition to the danish decor.  we also appreciated the well stocked bathrooms, with shower gel and shampoo, plus toilet paper and kleenex, because we arrived on christmas eve.  we used the parking permit and found easy, nearby parking for our rental car.  i highly recommend this home to anyone, especially families, visiting dc."
1789722,8203939,2013-10-20,814014,Lauren,"this place is really special. we have been to dc many times and have always enjoyed the city, but the experience jenny and jason offered made our last visit one of the most enjoyable trips we've ever taken. 
these are world-class hosts; there's simply no other way to say it. if you want to experience dc like a local, you need look no further.  they told us where to eat (like a vietnamese enclave just across the virginia border with some of the best food we've had anywhere) and suggested little known yet fascinating historic sites most tourists would never find (like the boundary stone, a 1791 demarcation of the original dc border). on their recommendation, we even rented bikes from the capital bike share program -- a short walk from the front door -- and saw interesting areas of dc we'd never before explored. 
the condo itself is immaculate: clean, cozy, and just downright beautiful. from the comfortable beds to the wonderfully appointed bathroom (the shower!) to the gorgeous art on the walls, we felt like we'd found a genuine home away from home. returning here after a long day enjoying the nation's capital made us wish we never had to leave. 
finally, the neighborhood itself left nothing to be desired. delicious food, cool bars, and excellent shopping opportunities were all just a short walk away. 
we hope to return soon to take further advantage of this excellent spot!
ps: if you're an avid traveler, take advantage of their collection of travel guides and pick jason's brain on his adventures all over the world. during a casual conversation he helped us plan our  itinerary for a week long trip to the yucatán, mexico. "
1789722,8269983,2013-10-22,7574605,Courtney,what a gorgeous place! the location is amazing as we were able to walk to get coffee and breakfast and even the farmers market. easy access to buses as well. the neighborhood alone was really nice to walk around in. all the amenities needed and the bed was extremely comfortable. the separate entrance from the main home was perfect as we didn't feel like we were disturbing anyone coming and going. jenny and jason were great and made sure we had everything we needed.  i highly recommend anyone staying in dc to consider this place!
1789722,8452246,2013-10-31,9340018,Helen Rose,"love at first sight! that is how i would describe this place. it had been an amazing and stress-free experience with the help of jason and jenny. the condo has everything you need : a comfortable and relaxing bed ( helps you to recharge after a busy day going around dc ), complete amenities (from the living room, kitchen, bathroom and laundry area) speedy wifi connection ( anywhere inside the house and even in the backyard patio) plus a romantic ambience when you dim the lights. the condo is also sound proof so you can have fun and enjoy all night long :).  the condo is also near grocery stores, resto and other tourist spots and  its just a few minute walk to the metro station. jason and jenny are both good people they had provided all the necessities that you will possibly need during your stay to the smallest details. they are just a text away. the one thing i greatly appreciated is that jason and jenny made the condo very secured for their guest hence, if security is one of your priority this is definitely the place for you.

this is definitely my home away from home. thanks jason and jenny. hope to see you again soon!

ps. thank you for the welcome gift :) :) :)"
1789722,8555426,2013-11-04,4198884,Kayla,"this is the place to stay in dc! 
jenny's place is located in mt pleasant - a charming, local, eclectic, and historical neighborhood in dc. the local scene is filled with great restaurants, interesting shops, and is a short walk to the national zoo. and it's an easy 10 minute walk to the yellow metro line that will get you to all the downtown sights in about 15 minutes. 
the house itself is wonderful. you'd pay thousands a night for a space like this in a dc hotel. it's a very newly renovated basement suite, and is a huge, modern space filled with art, books, and great little finishings (e.g., everything you need to make a french press coffee, including the bean grinder).  
jenny and her family were lovely - she greeted me and showed me around, left us with a little survival goodie bag, and was easy to reach if we needed anything. 
i'll be booking again next time i'm in dc!

1789722,9444714,2013-12-29,9817343,Michael,"my family and i just finished up a great visit to washington, dc with friends and family over the christmas holidays.  this was due in no small part to the wonderful accommodations at jenny’s place. the location is convenient for visiting both the old (mall, downtown, etc.) and the new (columbia heights, adams morgan, u street corridor, etc.) hotspots of washington. the house was beautiful, well-appointed and had all of the amenities we needed (wi-fi, flat screen tv with movie access, fridge, etc.). most of all, jenny’s space comfortably slept 5 people (with the help of a self-inflating, blow-up, queen-size mattress) and was within walking distance to my mother’s apartment on the edge of columbia heights. jenny was also a good host, checking in via text from time to time to see if we needed anything and to make sure our visit was going well. because i am a native washingtonian, i didn’t use the many restaurant recommendations, suggested activities and maps that were available to us at the house. still a nice touch nonetheless.  all in all, jenny’s place did not disappoint. i will seek to stay here again on return visits with my family, as well as recommend her spot to my friends."
